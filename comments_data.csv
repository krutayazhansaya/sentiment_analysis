here in nz 50 of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like paywave which support apple pay they don’t like the high fees that come with these,negative
i will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations now its quite helpful while youll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account growth,positive
whenever i go to a place that doesn’t take apple pay doesn’t happen too often it’s such a drag between ‘contactless covid’ habits and my getting the apple card i’ve gotten so used to apple pay that i get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it it feels like a shock it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine i’ve officially been brainwashed by apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket,negative
apple pay is so convenient secure and easy to use i used it while at the korean and japanese airports no need for physical credit cards,positive
we only got apple pay in south africa in 20202021 and it’s widely accepted,positive
in the united states we have an abundance of retailers that accept apple pay but its still good to carry the physical card with you being there are still a large quantity of places that do not accept apple pay,positive
wow you really went to town on the psu test rack thats a serious bit of kit very flexible good choices wouldnt surprise me if choma start offering this bespoke rack to the psu makers they all watch your videos so theyll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack you can really push the industry here well done open source the test interface hardware and software,positive
the lab is the most exciting thing in it ive seen for a while this is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured,positive
linus im an engineer and love the lmg content across all the channels very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles,positive
there used to be a time where linus was the smartest guy in the room this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make linus look like a child kudos to linus and lmg youve grown beyond what i imagined all the best,positive
holy crap i was looking at chroma systems back when i was designing power supplies looks like you guys went all out re the multimeter most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements 810 bit adcs they are just for looking at the waveforms,negative
i love the direction this channel is going most tech channels even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc but youre really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is love it,positive
i am more excited for the ltt lab than i have been for a lot of content for a while now as everyone seems to be saying its exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running,positive
i adore the working relationship linus has with his team 99 of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and i wish it could be more like this,positive
lmgs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for this is the content we want to watch more technical in depth engineering oriented and sciencebased content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but well know exactly why we picked it which helps greatly with buyers remorse,positive
i love all the people ltt has added for labs clearly theyre knowledgeable and passionate about tech labs is gonna be killer love it,positive
linus just turn the key lights 180 and bounce them off the walls you’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it’s such a simple fix i’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face ,positive
dan continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence like dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine,positive
dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,positive
linus gets on his employees cases for all the stuff stolen from the office also linus proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work hes using in his upgraded setup linus why are you using this monitor as a table also linus uses the monitor as a chair this video was hilarious,positive
dan the man saving the day riley needs to give him his own theme like brian the electrician,positive
dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,positive
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,positive
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,positive
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at4053b,positive

everyone has been saying it but i’ll throw my hat in as well to any prospective college students you do not need to spend money on flagship products i am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base ipad from late 2020 both products have worked flawlessly and i have no intention of replacing them the recommendations listed are ones i would never be able to afford even with my job i’m working as well do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is i promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it,positive
shoutout to my oneplus phone and huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for much less bonus ups for ikeas articulating lamps 20 and i can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain the old door i refinished to use as a desktop and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my noisecancelling headphones and the same 2 sets of hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride,positive
you dont necessarily need the highend and latest tech for university i used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine whats important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating,positive
personally i feel like this is really out of touch most students wont be able to afford these in case anyone needs it i believe dave2ds back to school video are honestly the best ones ive seen on the topic consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision,positive
hey everyone good take on the video and love the recommendations if you plan on making another video such as this maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options what i can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what coursesprogramme you took for your education engineering students require computer specs that can run bim software im not sure about the other programmes but from what i can see that most students at my place has 8gb of ram for their laptops also here is my setup during my university years hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their collegeuniversity years all the best laptop asus x455l upgraded to ssd with additional ram phone vivo y69redmi 10samsung a22 4g mouse logitech g102 keyboard tecware tkl ver,positive
i have used galaxy tab s7 during my phd its been a lifesaver for me first of all it is really good for reading journals note taking and scribbling on the pdfs secondly it doesnt strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with tab s7 and lastly if you are from a stem background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams you can draw those easily with the stylus on tab s7 i choose tab s7 over apple ipad air for its ease of use user interface and cost you get stylus for free with tab s7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount,positive
this series is exactly what career day shouldve been such interesting and knowledgeable people,positive
how does every person wired brings on this show act like theyve been in front of cameras 5000 times,negative
his face when describing hops killed me “some of them smell pretty… dank “,negative
seasoned craft brewery tour guide here and i’m so glad he ended on “drink what you like” sometimes people get weirdly judgmental about the beer preferences of others at the end of the day there are hundreds of beer styles for a reason so everyone can find at least one style they actually like,positive
this guy is a total bro not snobby at all and just wants people to enjoy beer in whatever way they want such a contrast with your stereotypical beverage elitists,positive
y’all be picking the literal best professionals for these videos not only is everyone knowledgeable but they all seem passionate and eager to teach us,positive
this guy has a face made for movies a voice made for radio and a great personality i wanna see more of garrett,positive
whenever we get people young enough to actually understand the internet these giant tech companies might be broken up but as long as we have 90 year old senators asking tech ceos how the internet works nothing will get done,negative
i live for johns roasts of att,positive
mad respect to john oliver and his team for not making us watch ads during the show major props,positive
one important aspect im surprised was left out is that many of these companies like amazon literally power the internet almost 30 of the websites on the internet are stored on amazon servers giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet,positive
back in 2018 when john oliver did the episode on corporate consolidation it inspired me so much that i applied for a masters of research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a phd in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector edit wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent published it yet otherwise i would share it with all you lovely people  i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know ,negative
john oliver deserves an oscar for his can dolphins love you monologue,positive
hey something that might interest you a couple of days ago my amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats beside the point when they closed my amazon account all my amazon devices that i own for years primarily all my echo devices stopped working i lost access to the amazon photos and prime video which i pay for so apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by amazon on your perceived shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon devices and services like fire os tablets ring cameras and probably aws as well just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,negative
hey hey just a heads up i did turn the led hoodie on its just not very bright hen youre looking faceon at it you can still sort of see it on around the hood area though  if you had fun on this video heres my collection of extreme unboxing videos,positive

infinity dodecahedrons are seriously cool i bought another smaller one and i really enjoy it its definitely an eye catcher and a conversation starter,positive
i personally enjoy the old school phones i have such a hard time hearing my iphone at max volume without the speaker on if i worked in an office i would definitely buy one people forget how ergonomic those old phones are its not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head i also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones ear phones whatever cause me a bunch of pain looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone,positive
the fact he didnt buy the nicholas cage spoon is outrageous,negative
i have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey youre on this year has been effective it simply feels like youre enjoying life and its what i enjoy most about watching your videos you manage to pass that joy on just the musings of a random stranger ,positive
i havent laughed like this for years oh my gosh arun youve nailed this one wendi ,positive
quality quality quality is everything about this channel arun makes my mood happier video after video lets be searious the best part about this channel is arun making his jokes and when he shows tech,positive
as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting it is a huge vector for exploit it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,negative
the fire suppression without water was incredible it could save many lives and property especially if it could be auto activated like a heat detector imagine how much property and how many sleeping people could be saved especially if this had a built in alarm and was rigged to keep hallways clear of fire what an inventionwow,positive
id really appreciate a study into the potential advantages of meta materials in manipulating light emf heat and even replacing silicon as semiconductors nearly every industry can benefit from the improvements and cost reductions meta materials can provide really enjoy your videos thank you,positive
i was totally shocked that fusion power generation wasnt included possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity,negative
i love the one about the hydrogen fuel cellsconsidering this technology has been around for about 20 yearsjust hasnt been used due to a lack of pressure on the industry and the fact that the patent was buried by large corporate interests,positive
i wish that when people talked about types of skin damage theyd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin we dont get red rashes after sunburn even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyperpigmentation the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we dont see the same change in colors around the wound sight not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs 99 of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues,negative
she has a very effective way of delivering information in a way that is accessible love her,positive
if the lead singer is bret michaels then im sure it is poison that had me laughing for ages ,positive
anne is so cool she makes me want to reevaluate my life choices and return to college to become a toxicologist,positive
poison support is one of the more interesting ones of this series im glad to see anne back in the seat and schooling us hoping for more,positive
my son had botox injections in his legs for years to relax his muscles enough so he could wear splits he has cerebral palsy its crazy knowing that this life changing treatment is also the most dangerous poison,negative
my mom wouldve gone nuts for you while i was growing up lol her big parent fear was toxic chemicals and me getting poisoned so she was always lecturing me about stuff under the sink and making sure i didnt touch the pesticides for the farm once she figured out she could call pbs and theyd send her mr yuck stickers the house and barn were covered in them,negative
i love how she says that it is poison in the right dose instead of the wrong dose,positive
my husband got sun poisoning last year all the symptoms you described it was not fun he said his sick were he got burned felt tight for a few months after luckily he is a nurse and he was able to give me advice on how to help him in his recovery,negative
marques does a fantastic job highlighting the features of the link if youre looking for the next level of webcam look no further  dope tech dope video,positive
the camera is amazing and there are so many people who could benefit from it a lot,positive
i’ve been playing with the insta360 link for about a week now as a college professor and edtech trainer i can tell you that this is a complete game changer for online and hybrid teaching switching from follow mode to whiteboard mode to topdown mode for demos etc is a purely magical experience,positive
i honestly have to say while its still insanely expensive 3500 for that monitor isnt as bad as i was expecting and its almost reasonable like its still more than i would ever spend on a single display and im far more into having separate displays but given what its capable of the specs the tech behind it etc its not that bad i can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,positive
imagine losing the cursor on that screen and trying to find it ,negative
this monitor is perfect for streaming three 27“ monitors in one is amazing  but man is it expensive ,positive
i can see this being good for editing and streaming reading the chat and playing the game on one screen this is genius,positive
geez i need a dedicated studio for all of this dope tech in my future,positive
this has gotta be one of the best dope techs everything here is a hit that i’m def writing down for later,positive
i’m always looking forward to these every month so thank you for making them honestly that little lamp and speaker caught my eye the flickering is really cool to me and the speaker is a nice extra,positive
the sound test killed me that was hilarious and the wrist rest is brilliant i often get marks on my wrist from my mousepad,positive
what a tough selection this month whether it be the soundbar the lamp speaker or even the pc panel display they all seem something that would really improve my set up but for me it may have to be the soundbar one looks smart has nice rgb and a decent size and price very good month of tech this month,positive
i absolutely love this series all of the items were neat but the only one i would actually benefit from would be the chair wheels i have a regular office chair that has to roll on carpet and it is kind of a pain,positive
that sensor panel is definitely convenient been wanting to make my own with a raspberry pi but just find myself getting off track super cool to just be able to purchase and go,positive
the rgb sound bar would be perfect for my setup i’ve been using the speakers in my monitor as my main sound system so it would be a nice upgrade for me,positive
i always love franks energy i also look forward to the end of every month thinking about this series i love the tiltednation soundbar and i need that for my set up,positive
always great to see this series so many cool things this month my office setup could use those chair wheels,positive
this series has helped me and my friends find some helpful tech that has helped our setups the pc panel is gonna be a huge upgrade,positive
we need the under 100 for august as well this is the best series out there,positive
one really important point those ionizers can produce potentially dangerous levels of ozone due to the negative ions they create in the air id be cautious of all air ionizers unless they are advertised specifically as bipolar ionizers the one that you recommended does produce ozone which can be very harmful,negative
been a good while since ive been a student but i still watched the vid to find out what cool gadgets are out there didnt think id be walking away from it with a productivity tip that idea of the simple timer is so good instead of devices that can also do time great vid frank,positive
the desktop lamp is definitely my favorite it’s also something i’ve been looking for because i updated to a keyboard that doesn’t have shine through keycaps so it’s definitely a need too,positive
i’m not a student however i always love seeing the tech always looking to change and upgrade my desk setup for work,positive
fantastic video frank you always bring really cool stuff to the front that most of us havent seenheard anything about hope you and the fam are doing well xd btw that kb for only 100 i know theyve gotten a lot cheaper but hot damn i dont need it but i want it lol my biggest complaint with 60 kbs is the lack of arrow keys and this has those and looks super sleek with those colors love it take care man,positive
ugh hate when my summer holidays end at least you brighten my mood with this top tech series thanks,positive
awesome variety of products i also like that you had more than five or six items love the budget finds ,positive
you missed a feature on the airbolt instead of using the big part of the loop to lock your zippers lock the zippers on the loop where the 2 notches are that way you cant open the bag 3 inches,negative

i just wanted to say thank you for making such amazing content we notice all the hard work you do and appreciate it so much,positive

i love you guys i hope you know that  you guys brighten my day with these massive tech unboxing videos,positive
the whole idea of the interchangeable battery to keep going of the steel series is exactly the reason why xbox still uses aa batteries for their controllers i think is in an undervalued decision from xbox,negative
in my experience burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesnt produce improved rewards it produces more work the response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus instead good work is rewarded with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all its worth young people are almost never treated as the companys future,negative
i am 50 years old working in the high tech industry mentally tired and sick of the weekly 8 to 5 routine never got a proper day off even through the pandemic hats off to the millenials and genz that think differently and put more weight on living rather than just working,negative
i think the pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job doesn’t mean security,negative
successful people dont become that way overnight what most people see at a glance wealth a great career purposeis the result of hard work and hustle over time i pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life,positive
as someone who used to work 80 hours a week quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing i have ever done sure i still work a lot of hours and often close to 7080 hrs a week i feel like i am doing this for myself and not some corporation,positive
i have a high paying tech job that i’m about to leave i feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it even though i worked hard to get to where i am i was promoted very fast after 5 years i know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly i’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot ultimately i became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life i have lived humbly saved every thing i could paid off debts as quickly as possible and have enough to live for 8 months to a year i’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling for anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining i hope you achieve your dream and get one you can do it keep at it taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing i am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me don’t let that scare you i just have my own personal stuff too ,positive
i’m a software developer i understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars we are very privileged to be where we are most jobs outside of tech have less perks much lower pay and more stress i am grateful everyday to be in this field once i accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom i’ll see myself out maybe in the meantime i will run the race as long as i have to,positive
the thing is if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility you must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off this also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders,positive
compare that to physicians only 42 said they were burned out yes indeed a perfectly acceptable percentage,positive
i worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out the problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused you can barely keep up though i got promoted regularly my higher ups told me the truth before they left they said that i was severely underpaid based on my skills essentially i branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as i am both technically knowledgeable people oriented and strategic i maxed out at 50k so i decided to jump ship with little planned now i run a financial agency with my husband and we make 250k a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle,negative
that boat pod looks a lot like a saiyan space capsule… i need one lol,positive
those window breakers seems like an easy way to rob someone’s car,negative
i would love the glasses and the digital artwork frame,positive
cool ,positive
nice i love it,positive
damn the mueral canvas is nice too pricey,negative
if you could limit your products to things that are available retail it would be awesome kickstarter and indiegogo etc dont count too many scams and failed products and no protections,negative
from all the stuff mentioned i have the dji mic amazing recording device,positive
this guy must be the richest youtuber i hear his voice on most tech channel ,positive
from all the stuff mentioned i have the dji mic amazing recording device,positive
that motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh if you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor pick up the laptop and perhaps step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain by the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip,negative
that cable organiser would be incredible in my dorm room,positive
the trene control alarm will not deter someone who really wants it they will just knock that gadget off and run with your property,negative
enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up,positive
i spent hours researching dash cams a year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is i was totally surprised how under developed they are this is a video that is really necessary,negative
vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams well done in the research thanks ltt,positive
i did not expect to love this video as much as i did it epitomizes the very best of youtube in my opinion a wellmade video with a wellconstructed narrative hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone even if they are not in the market for these products love your work ltt team,positive
thank you linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit i will be keeping your recommendations in mind when i purchase my camera,positive
this is the kind of content that we need calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers doing the sidebyside comparisons they cant do thanks for this glad to know the rove r24k i got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is good enough if not overpriced a bit,positive
yup its amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country in germany we have an entirely different line of knockoff chinese brands which ultimately look alike same goes for the australian american market i am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within south korea japan if anybody could give a hint to that i mean surely they must have great dashcams right japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts and well south korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind i bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine problem i have with it is quality related the gsensor broke not long after i bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate this creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings and in that mode you cant disable the screen from flashing so at night drives youll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope its your f dashcam you can improve further the video quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ndfilter you just have to find your own way to mount them usually there is full filter clamping solutions because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow i didnt do this yet as i did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so name of the channel is eure videos fahrnünftig german amazon thieye cv3211 american market jansite nexigo d80 australian nz market volway,positive
in all fairness the viofo actually looks pretty great actually worth considering over the thinkware f70 if the budget isnt too tight,positive
when i went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery cause i really dont think the batteries would handle the 20 to 30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior i know you can take them off but i kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system for actual performance its much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading unless you really know your camera sensor specs,negative
i had my suspicions about this for a long time thank you for finally calling this issue out it sounds like theres a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam thats not chinese crap hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in im tired of all these countless trash brands on amazon with unpronounceable names,negative
ive been wanting to make this video for such a long time that royole display was just so hard to get hold of by holy cow was it worth it to check out my other ridiculous tech unboxings,negative
i love the fact that you put “thinnest rick roll” and “can you legally employ a cat” on the search history even if it flashed on the screen for a second you are one of the only creators that put 100 effort and detail into their content keep it up,positive
i’d say the coolest thing in this video is the desk pc saves room and it’s cool to see the desk but i wonder how much it cost and if it’s worth buying,positive
im just here to say thank you to him the generosity he has shown will forever be in my heart thanks for the perfect job,positive
i own a remarkable 2 and that feeling surreal to hold was the same thing i felt when i got it its great for anyone wanting a device to write with for school and so much thinner and easier to carry around than a notebook or binder especially since you can import and export pdfs for downloading and submitting assignments online,positive
man i love how he went from a smartphone focused creator to just all inventions overall this is incredible keep it up arun ,positive
thankyou for the effort you put into your videos you spend thousands on each video just for your fans respect ,positive
that desk pc is now on my bucket list ,positive

in spite of the huge upgrades especially for the pro models it would be interesting to see how many will upgrade to the iphone 14 lineup given that the iphone 13 lineup is as popular as ever,positive
honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros as a iphone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol,positive
definitely upgrading from my 12 pro max to the 14 pro max ill get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in major upgrade in battery camera and the screen,positive
in my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made seems i’m in a minority but it’s brilliant,positive
eh i’m sticking with my 13 pro max until probably the 15 or 16 the cameras on the 14 pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo,positive
im going to wait for the scheduled iphone 15 pro which will be scheduled to release in october 2023 if everything goes to plan it is expected to have a usb c port and faster charging like the iphone 14 series this is what really matters for me,positive
i might upgrade from my 11 pro to the 14 max i guess i don’t care enough to spend the money on the pro max but i want the bigger display and better battery life,positive
the information is easily digestible thanks,positive

gotta say this is one of the best episodes of the series in a while i actually think every single one of these things would be something id go out to buy especially the led sign i finally am picking back up my plan to build my own pc and the flexibility of the sign adds a lot of well flexibility on how i want my endgame to turn out,positive
teachers there are no stupid questions wolfgang puck well tracey thats a stupid question,negative
hes a nice fun guy he told my dad at an event my dad was cooking at that he had never seen so many steaks cooked so perfectly so quickly and its one of his favorite memories we have a signed picture with him and my parents in it d,positive
idk if this was intentional but i really like how he said “practice makes better” rather than “practice makes perfect”,positive
“have a drink or smoke a joint” thanks chef i’ll do both,positive
i think its kinda cool that elizabeth haigh sent the tweet about nervous breakdowns the same month she opened her restaurant and now that her question is being answered she has a michellin star,positive

i can’t wait to put edible flowers all over my morning cheerios,positive

the price of todays bikes is absolutely bonkers doesnt make any sense whatsoever if you compare it to motorcycles or even cars,negative
the price of the roadgoing kawasaki really tells how overpriced the push bikes are,negative
fun fact about horsepower its the amount of power a horse can sustain for an entire day so a galloping horse actually has 15 horsepower,positive
i love and ride both types of two wheeled transportation  gcntech your talking my language,positive
another great video two  thumbs up i know little to nothing about about motorcycle riding nevertheless the gcn team once again has brought another layer to overall world of cycling which for me makes even more interesting wishing the best for scott his team ,positive
this was a fascinating look at something i love by some genuinely interested people i will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike for a lower key series and still have fun on the track i have a minitwin which is relatively cheap to run but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix however i far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track all of which you can do on a minitwin ,positive
as a lapsed superbike obsessive it always bothered me hearing gcn call top road bikes superbikes now i mostly watch cycling and im used to it,negative
hanging onto my 8t for now curious to see what oneplus does after the 10 overall coz the 9 10 didnt move me they keep constantly moving from what made them great with each variant  the oneplus 6 being their last great phone,positive
i’m waiting for the oneplus 10s or p or q,positive
pretty happy with the oneplus 9 camera is killer for sunny days on the beach the oneplus carbon fiber case makes it feel excellent in the hand,positive

lots of profit negative tech startup companies with an over abundant of overpaid employees…honestly who hasn’t seen this coming,negative
what slowdown lol it was abnormally fast and now with the recession vcs realized many of these startups aren’t profitable so they laid off people the big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn’t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon,negative
slow hirings may be caused by a rapid rising labor cost in hi tech ind,negative
thats really a problem with service economy most tech companies dont even produce a nail they do things that are intangible you cay easily live without them if netflix goes down i am sure there will not be any catastrophic event if some manufacturing companies goes down lets say the one that makes baby formula it could trigger a panic,negative
good video as usual ,positive
the future of tech is looking more and more amazing,positive

enjoyed your video and i gave it a thumbs up for the support of your channel,positive
209 so im guessing when you make an ad for your product do you really want a guy sleeping right in the middle with an it is what it is pillow lol while everyone else is having fun 237 and that blistering scooter speed of 030 meters per hour i think you meant kilometers per hour all in all pretty cool stuff i like the coolper i can really see that taking off huupe seems to be novelty i can imagine the horror as soon as someone forgets there is a tv there and slams a ball only to shatter the device lol the life straw actually works ive seen several science channels take pond water and view it under a microscope then filter it and view it again it really does work but it does not filter out chemicals in the water just microparticles and microbes,positive
im over this channel because 90 of the products they feature in their videos are on kickstarter and honestly at this point they should change the name from kick starter to never starter lol im just saying as im also laughing my butt off because that was hella funny and its also hella true and yes it was also hella shady as well sorry i couldnt help myself anyway back to my point because trust me its a really good point and just in case youre still laughing let me get you back on track so like i said 90 of the products featured on this channel and its sister channel or products that are on kickstarter and about 80 to 90 of the products on kickstarter never even make it to market thats right you read that correct and my numbers are correct because i did my research so basically this channel future tech and its sister channel the future is now both channels are useless because over 90 of the products that they show you you will never ever be able to purchase so basically honestly its a waste of everybodys youtube time unless you like looking at videos that feature products and gadgets that will never come to market and that you will never be able to purchase seriously on being funny and sarcastic but also serious because honestly im so over it and im over this channel thats why i have unsubscribe and im telling everybody else to unsubscribe so have you unsubscribed please everybody unsubscribe because at this point in time future tech and the future is now and all those channels that display products that are on kickstarter and the keyword here is display because basically all the products are prototypes that are on display and the public will never be able to buy them because they will never come to market oh kickstarter oops im sorry i mean never starter oh my god im sorry i couldnt help myself because its still so funny lol  but like i said these products never end up going to market and never end up being sold so this whole useless channel is a waste of my time and your time and everybody elses time okay now guess what times up so goodbye and remember everybody please do yourself a big favor and unsubscribe,positive

it still blows my mind that companies have entire teams deciding whether or not a flavor is going to appeal to the masses and yet somehow swedish fish flavored oreos were still greenlit,negative
that “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what i was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and i was trying to test that out on my own and never could i would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth i have never heard anyone say it wasn’t true so it’s cool to hear now,positive
this woman is unbelievably amazing i want a phd in taste and i want her to be my professor i’m a lawyer and after this one video i’m prepared to quit and pursue taste ,positive
what she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true i always think delivery pizza smells so good and it’s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing just not the same without the box ,positive
when i was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake five flavors taste zones thing and i never got it i could always taste everything on every part of my tongue i felt vindicated like two decades later when it came out that that was horsecrap but i cant exactly go rub it in my kindergarten teachers face can i,negative
the amount of people wired gets to interview is amazingall of them has the passion of the kinds of job they r doing idk if job is the right word to use when ua doing something what u love,positive
also the amount of carbonation to syrup isnt set in the soda machines and can be changed a soda with more carbonation is a dry soda a restaurant i loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet whichever was your preference,positive
maybe its because i know shes an audiologist but she annunciates everything beautifully and speaks with an even sound level like she clearly works with the hearing impared to naturally say every sound in a word to be heard as easily as possible,positive
i’m so glad she talked about how hearing aids are more complicated than just a mic and speaker as someone who has had two of them since i’ve been four i’ve had to explain that so many times also having automatic bluetooth ears is super cool,positive
my doctor also told me that our ears are selfcleaning but when i pressured her for some offtherecord advice she finally conceded that if i really really felt the need to clean inside my ear canal i could go ahead and use my elbows i just adore my doctor,positive
brilliant wellspoken wellenunciated and a welcoming and animated face great video i learned a lot,positive
the way i was hyped to to this i was born with hearing loss so i had to see many audiologist in my life so far people like her made my life so much easier her talking about hearing aids and clearing up misconceptions or even spreading knowledge made me smile ear to ear,positive
about earplugs at concerts there are a variety of frequencybalanced earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music eargasm and hearos are a couple of examples i highly recommend them,positive
honestly my main take away is that ive been saying tinnitus wrong my whole life,negative
loved this as someone who previously studied to be an audiologist in the past also just love all of the expert answers videos on this channel thanks wired and dr emily,positive
this was super fascinating although the part about the ear drum being able to self repair was the most surprising to me,positive
the universal hate for printers is what unites humanity,negative
i suddenly gained immense amount of respect for dyson after watching this,positive
im just shocked and saddened that theyve ignored the most significant vacuum cleaner advance the retractable cord,negative
you know you’ve made it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction,positive
james dyson is actually giving really good advice here a lot of these types of qas give really generic advice,positive
probably the best interviewanswers so far he leaps off the screen with his eloquent and articulate manner it is very apparent that he is simply a genius,positive
this was so entertaining i had no idea the person behind dyson was a true genuine and passionate inventor and to see him speak so nicely about independent designers and the unfair problems they face was amazing,positive
james dyson makes legendary household appliances like vacums and hair dryers also james dyson loves his cast aluminum pencil sharper the little things in life,positive

thank you for the amazon voucher great content as always,positive
hey by popular demand i made a list of all cool tech under 50 products from the last 3 years archived so you can see it all on 1 page,positive
my favorite product was definitely the wireless desk charger hope i can finally win one of these love your videos frank keep up the great work,positive
on the wireless phone charger i could see installing it under the wood in your nightstands if you have the right kind of furniture for the job also the echo dot stand is super cute definitely made me think of portal turrets too definitely my favorite,positive
loved the “invisible” charger would definitely contribute to keeping my clean,positive
wow that wireless desk charger is insanely cool i would love one of those,positive
this channel is actually really cool instead of being just a kickstarter compilation these are all actual product reviews going to watch a few more before subscribing but so far extremely good channel,positive
this might be the best episode of this series ever so many great ideas,positive
the charger was my favorite the hidden feature is cool but what i really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,positive
what an awesome video i love to see new affordable products come out this makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price if more technology can be produced at cheaper costs there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everydayused devices such as laptops or desktops,positive
i love wireless setups and the wireless charger is always a bonus thanks for the best content as always,positive
oh imagine when they get those sound wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick the people animals and homes saved would be amazing not to mention the forests as well what a brilliant invention ,positive
imagine we could just buy a sized sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any window or surface we like such as a mirror bench top or car windscreen and then be able to utilise it like a touch screen  would be more practical than buying an expensive mirror,positive
it’s awesome but what happens to the humans that used to do these jobs,positive
i can confirm her squirrel facts i raised an orphaned one and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal biting scratching trying to eat my face off it was a sad day but ive checked wanting a squirrel off my list,negative

declawing cats stop calling it declawing it has nothing to do with the claws as the vet said it is amputating the toes cats have claws if you have a problem with claws dont get a cat,negative
thank you for addressing declawing cats and how awful and hurtful it is to the cat,negative
i have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner he has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats he was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal,negative
this woman was born to be a vet you can just tell shes the 1 of kindergarten girls whos living the dream ,positive
exotic animals as pets should be illegal tigers dont belong in farms sugar gliders dont belong in apartments sad to see that this happens still,negative
if you decide to brush a cats teeth a fencing mask is highly recommended,positive
i had a recent fall at work and because i trained myself how to fall off a bike safely i only had minor bruising on my butt i did a tuck and roll like when i fall off the bike great advise alex and ollie,positive
when i got right hooked a few years ago i only had time to think “this is gonna suck” and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement fortunately i came away with ‘only’ bruises and road rash nothing got broken and i think in part it was because i didn’t have a chance to put my hands out also glad i was wearing a helmet,positive
askgcntech after two years of running tubes i finally went tubeless a couple of months ago i managed to puncture my tyre the other day sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs even tried a patch inside the tyre the puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large given the tire had plenty of life left i am gutted that i may have to discard the tire now when would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is ko,negative
my last crash 3 yrs ago i was on the ground so fast i had no time to react or prepare for the impact but the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool,positive
another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim water is incompressible unlike air so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact,negative
askgcntech as a heavier rider i feel i’m always in the max range of gears either hardest gear on flat’sh roads or my easiest gear when i see any sustained gradients i currently run a compact chain set with a 1230 cassette on the rear would i benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear,negative
i bought an old tractor to help clear the land i was building on stick with me i was towing a large log when i felt the back of my leg getting wet no problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires tyres apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres tires with water to improve traction due to the added weight maybe sealant would be a better idea expensive though love the show guys,positive
having shot canon for 20 years i switched the nikon in 2016 love both brands but prefered the nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate r5 really improved that but i love the isoless nature of the nikon sensors canon is getting better in that regard but still behind nikon and sony,positive
hey marques i know these sound insignificant but since you rarely update your little donglesaccessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens i think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what youd like to see changedsimplified with those work flows just an idea,positive
mkbhd im a photographer and use the peak edc v2 im impressed you got a 16 into the 20l im sure its a snug fit and doesnt leave alot of room for a ipad too wanted to give you a little tip i found on that bag here goes the main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones airpods etc go you just have to fish a cable through the corner i do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable it makes it so i can leave a pass through usb travel battery charger with folding prongs that means i plug in all my devices when theyre in the zip area laptop phone tablet and airpods and they all get charge from the battery and when i get to the hotel late i just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and i hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place not only that when theyre done charging the battery starts charging i wake up with everything ready to go hope you enjoy trying this out,positive
would love to see an edcdaily tech for everyone else in the studio,positive
marquess reaction was genuine here he was excited to know as what will come out of his bag next ,positive
i went to check out the opal camera because i need a webcam upgrade and it looked pretty legit i loved everything i saw on the site up until the point of the 4month fee to use their software on a 300 webcam i think ill just get a capture card for my mirrorless or pick up a logi webcam instead other than that nice tech kit also yeah your experience with the pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with pixel phones i got one to try something different to the iphone and i loved it for a few months i tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldnt or it would reboot in the middle of doing something,positive
you are carrying great tech and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on apple their ecosystem is really good i am an android user and dont stick to just one brand but my wife is allapple and she really likes how seemless everything is cool stuff marques,positive
hey marques can you do an updated “the ecosystem explained” i think a lot of viewers would appreciate a video not only for apple side of the ecosystem but also android seeing as though a lot of new products are coming out in support for easy use for androids love all your videos btw ,positive
i can see that exoskeleton helping people with limited mobility in the future its a marvelous piece of tech thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come,positive
the exoskeleton probably wouldn’t be affordable for everyone to use and may have long term effects but i think it would be amazing for rehabilitation and other medical related use,positive
ive got that azeron keypad highly recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal but especially for gaming highly highly you can even find certain models on amazon usually i ordered mine from the factory for the color scheme and one of the newer designs the one on this video is the original design which im sure is still just as phenomenal but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem,positive
the game pad that you highlighted actually is already available i am a right arm amputee and also a big gamer and was considering buying it but it’s over 200 us and you would still need a mouse also i have already become very proficient using a standard controller for gaming already and mostly mostly use an xbox controller for my pc so i decided it wasn’t worth it but it’s still a very good design in my opinion and i would love to see how it feels to use irl just not at that price point lol,positive
cyborg game controller looks pretty neat i am from from latvia and that company makes pretty high end gaming gear expensive too,positive
i will forever appreciate this channel youve helped me and my family a lot your videos advice lessons and funny words are inspirational and helpful to us my husband and i have been able to minimal conscious in spending saving and investing wisely i now earn every week youre such a blessing to this generation we all love you,positive
man to think one day i might be able to own a dehumidifier and a battery wow,positive
yes the game pad is incredibly convenient but incredibly expensive so seemingly lower quality production than its competitors that being said i would sure love to have one,positive
when someone tells a lie deep down they know this is wrong they have no compassion,negative
when you as an employee are fired from a company and the reasons they are giving you are “poor performance or lack of culture fit” trust me when i tell you the real reasons are not disclosed been there done that companies lie hr works for the company and also lies and a corporation hierarchy matters when you lawyer up is when they start taking you a bit more seriously,negative
great daily blog you all do a great job picking the most relevant daily headline to cover such a high level discussion in such a short clip i watch or listen every day,positive
the market cycle still hasnt met its balance we keep going round in circles while waiting for that huge blow out on a huge support but in the mean time we could always ignore the market ups and downs and stay fully invested big thanks to lily alice for helping me earn over 14 btc by implementing her method and following her guide,positive

“once you spend 5 to 10 grand on magic cards you kinda don’t wanna pay for them anymore” really hits home for me,negative
its almost impressive how many ltt employees even with a 5k upgrade have the jankiest setups i have ever seen,positive
just a note on the screw driver put some extended bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it its very common for some screws to be deep in a hole and having those small bits into hex end wont go in far enough down the hole to extract screw i see this allot on laptops controllers that kinda thing sunk in screws suck,negative
ltt extreme tech upgrades will never not be absolutely funny and somewhat informative,positive
i think one of the things i love the most about these intel extreme upgrades is linus learning and getting angry at his employees for everything about their lives,positive
this episode has me cracking up hard love the rabbit hole that nick has gone down with the keyboard mods respect,positive
i love how even linus doesnt want to fit all those hard drives in in a such a jank way im with you linus ill do a lot to make things easier but thats a bit too far xd,positive
i love his space its messy full of things that he could throw away if he really went through it all but its a catalog of and container for life as hes living it rather than just a show piece,positive
after seeing the macro pad i was checking out their website and loved all their products ive wanted a product like this for when i stream to make it easier and this here is just what i need its a great product and id love it for my setup,positive
very surprised with this months list considering how every single item in the list feels like it could go with my setup or just seems super cool to me usually theres one or two items that i dont think id personally find useful but i am 100 adding all these items to my wishlist,positive
i absolutely loved the hoto laser measuring tool as an engineering student i am constantly measuring objects and like using various rulers i would love to own one of these hoto laser measuring tools for sure also this months list particularly caught my eye as everything listed seems like something i would want to purchase in the near future,positive
so many great products on this list these are all incredibly practical too especially the macropad the abililty to customize literally every aspect of it is killer,positive
the hoto laser was a pretty good change of pace loved it feels very complementary to the theme of office gadgets keep em coming ideas specific underdesk drawers and other more “furniture” alike stuff that will make your setup noice,positive
just discovered your channel and the series going to be watching your older ones today while working that macro pad is really cool that would definitely be something id pick up and use,positive

i’ve actually been looking for macro pads recently and you just upload the very thing i needed i love that you can customize it to fit your aesthetic truly a must have for any setup,positive

man i seriously love this series and the fact that you buy these failed products steps thing up a notch,positive
great to see you including a wider variety of stuff in these videos beyond just electronic devices especially the pharmaceutical industry if youre going to include banned medications then the top of the list in your next video should be thalidomide what it did was absolutely tragic it was banned decades ago yet people are still suffering and living with severe disabilities to this day thousands of families destroyed and lives lost too,negative
this is such a good video arun the amount of research locations and editing that this video needed is enormous thank you for doing this ,positive
arun looks so fit now im glad to see him taking care of himself too,positive
there was also another problem with the fitbit when some of the straps would irritate your skin and leave a rash and still the company hasnt dealt with it yet,negative
1035 this is a common misconception while part of the reason was the battery being too thin the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch which was a tiny dent in the top left corner this would cause the battery to eventually short out as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other most peoples phones were exploding while fast charging which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery and lithiumion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that edit normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine and would never cause issues but they made the battery too thin meaning it shorted it out easier just wanted to clarify that,negative
i now know i like this guy i at first thought i had some type of prejudicial dislike of him maybe because he was too smooth and that goes against my grain but i love this guy because he does seem to care about things and many of them seem not to be regarding how much money he can make off of a ad for a person it seems as his reviews are sincere and these seem not to have to do with what ive seen only from him which is technology i really love the fact that this guy cares about peoples safety and he brings up some safety issues which people should be concerned about if they have children especially with the toys and the baby monitors yeah this guy is getting a big a from me,positive
im hoping this video will blow you away so much work has gone into it and so many people have been fed because of it  to check out the tiniest tech,positive
i really appreciate this shaq episode and the effort that went into making it normal looking things scaled up seems much like mrbeast kinda thing think u got inspired by him i have seen the giant toblerone before in sorted the incredible cooking channel has shown the chocolate bar in their occasion based pretentious product series it cost may be 70 poundsbut what u showed is probably bigger than sorted oneits actually cool and it is my favourite chocolate bar too,positive
those earbuds are actually pretty cool decorate it somewhere good and it’d act like good speakers,positive
i actually have a mousemat that came with my desk thats larger than the one you have its specifically designed to cover the entire surface of the 55 inch desk since its a desk built for gaming,positive
wow i never seen technology that big before,positive
i have so much respect for you feeding the homeless with the cake,positive
if gaiman decides to start a youtube channel to talk about myths and history i would definitely watch that,positive
i know this isnt entirely uncommon with authors but ive always loved how much neil gaiman feels like a neil gaiman character,positive
you know it’s gonna be great when he says “unless it’s a furry minotaur” and then specified that this is going to be great,positive
its nice to see mr gaiman talk about death as being kind his friend and occasional coauthor terry pratchett wrote about death in the same way,positive
i love hearing neil speak and explain things he’s such a character ,positive
i have been in love with mr gaiman for decades and i couldnt click on this video fast enough major thanks to wired for this video and major thanks to mr gaiman for doing this for all us fans who cant get enough of him,positive

the problem with this that by focusing on totally different thing rather than better content we subscribers are paying the price with increasing subscription fee,negative
netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors this move into gaming will not do them any favours,negative
the reason netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content their own content when its good is constantly neglected and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what theyre doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults people are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update people are used to getting the next season of a series once every year but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release even before covid,negative
when i first got into watching netflix there were a lot of low budget but very original and interesting documentaries and tv series on it however in recent times i feel like a lot of the diversity in the platform has gone,positive
this is the problem with these big companies their core offering starts to fail and they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instead of making sure their core offering is decent,negative
i worked in retail for most of my life and the one thing i have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regardless of what you do,negative
i think it’s so silly that netflix feels the need to compete with youtube and tiktok i think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products eg people can follow along with reactionsreviews and video essays while watching a netflix series people also don’t typically like when youtubers are given a large budget like with youtube red originals so netflix buying out certain youtubers is not the right idea…,negative
honestly maybe it would have made more sense to commission more games based on their original ips yeah it takes longer to come out but you’ll get better quality and hopefully better return on investment,positive
i think this is gonna take netflix back to its feets it just needs more perseverance and the ability to be positive minded,positive

im surprised getting all the collectibles didnt even get an honorable mention theres been more than enough people who couldnt 100 the arkham games simply because they didnt like the riddler trophy collecting quest especially arkham knight due to how many times you had to use the batmobile just for those collectibles,negative
the one that annoyed me was the borderlands 1 when to obtain you had to play online with someone from gearbox or with someone who already had the trophy they changed it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once,negative
i always adored ffviii my older brother gifted me with the strategy guide when i first bought it so that may have something to do with it lol that said if youre trying to 100 ffviii on the og north american release good luck a strategy guide will not help you get the ribbon,positive
the original infamous hurt my soul i played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while i was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy cant be completed post game i had all but one stunt to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once when you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers therefore there isnt enough enemies to get the stunt i didnt have it in me to start another campaign the sad part is i had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt,negative
ac3 was super annoying when first released because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry problem was the controls were clunky af and the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like do not touch water,negative
multiplayer trophies tied to the platinum will always always be the worst,negative
so glad you did multiplayer awards lumped with single player awards that is the biggest bullshit for single game players that dont want to listen to children screaming neck beards eating or just racist hateful crap just for a trophy,negative
i honestly feel like cod mw on did it best on xbox 360 achievements for single player and challenges for multiplayer that was 2007 now i’m 34 with a wife and kids it’s almost unimaginable trying to do 100 a game with multiplayer supporting a family and working,positive

this honestly sounded like a legitimate prediction until the last part xd,positive
wow the concept of sending games over the internet lines sounds so compelling i wish online multiplayer was real ,positive
impossible nothing like that could ever be made,negative
man i love seeing old media predict the future correctly they even showed the lack of joy all gamers have,positive

massive thank you to everyone for checking out the video i went back and forward on making it whether it was too negative or not but very reassuring to know its not just me noticing these things and wanting to talk about them cheers scott,positive
i adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year if a game comes out in 2022 i wait until 2023 i get it at its cheapest and usually complete i have been doing this with every game i buy for the last 5 years and i have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more,positive
i used to preorder games to get the “collectible” toy that was sought after the items got really cheap really fast not worth it they also tell you that there may not be enough copies that never happened there was always enough copies,negative
good video these are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now publishers developers the media and gamers themselves have to throw one in though for every game with a yearly release i also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle how long between gta 5 and 6 fallout 4 and 5 skyrim and elder scrolls 6,positive
i wish developers would realize that forced drm and internet connectivity for games is a step backward look at the debacles gt7 and simcity have endured whats the point of paying a full 70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for singleplayer modes in my opinion at that point you cant help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job this is not why people play games,negative
when i think about the games i played the last few years i must say that i almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big ips so i rather pay 30€ for an indie title that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€ on a broken aaa title without any innovations,positive
i havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now the gaming industry has changed for a while now and its only getting worse i buy 34 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays cod and battlefield lost their way quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy goty editions usually and often second hand gotta love disc edition systems i refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers,negative
i tend to stick to games made before 2010 as they give the best value and experience feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player,positive
this video made me a bit sad made me realise how the industry has changed and not for the better i have young children so can’t game like i used to but when i do have time i find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that i’ve played before but adore the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me as for the new gen consoles…what’s the point all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games yawn,negative

ive been around for every console generation i remember thinking during the genesisturbografx era snes not out quite yet what games would be like when i was old and the kind of specs they would need obviously i had no idea what the specs really meant back then but i was thinking 256bit lol as for the cpu and 64bit is all we really need for that they have happily progressed faster than i had imagined looking just as good today if not better then i imagined things would look like 2025 years from now the 1990s and early 2000s with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the gpu were the main things that took us to where we are hardware wise,positive
we are an architecture and construction company in chile and we have used unreal engine for a long time and it is the best for realtime visualization  the preview versions of unreal 5 were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting lumion really changed everything its great that this is being talked about not only in games but also in movies and other experiences like ours there are plenty of tutorials to learn  we did it that way out of fear to learn it,positive
i actually home every game system dating back to my atari 2600 i never ever thought games would look this good i cant imagine how they will look 20 years from now with how fast technology keeps moving forward,positive
im over the moon hyped for the day before i hope it delivers in the hype like elden ring did if thats even possible for developers other than fromsoft,positive
most games these days look mind blowing especially when you can remember when gaming pretty much first started with games like pong etc,positive
i think we’ve reached the point that these devs need to come up with better idea and aí for decades now they just been able to make games look better a lot of games are actually worse gameplay wise with stale ideas and dumbed down mechanics than older games,negative
these games look insane cant wait to play some of them great list by the way,positive
im so glad i built a nice high end rtx 3090 pc a year ago its incredible the amount of eye candy 4k gaming treats us with no wonder its the biggest money making entertainment industry on the planet thanks for those awesome little previews nicely presented too much appreciated,positive

wow im impressed think theyve set a new bar with that spec and it being a 42,positive
this monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels i like how it’s got a tilt adjustable stand as well nice video,positive
my favorite part of this tv 42 is basically tv size is the custom heatsink i dont care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesnt dim the brightness constantly,positive
great video i think ill still be leaning toward the c2 though as the £400 price difference at the moment is too appealing,positive
awesome review what are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the lg c2 42 does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality i want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the c2 at a cheaper price this or perhaps wait another year for something new,positive
oled gaming wow please compare to the c2 you had as a monitor side by side to see that contrast difference uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the c2 42 and this love your content,positive
thanks for the review i cant wait for your full review my dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this 42 inches or so antiglare normal aspect ratio not ultra wide but 1440 200mhz instead of 4k because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway if possible i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review what do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor try playing a game in 10801440 and seeing what the monitors scaling is like in the settings what hdr options are available thanks,positive
hi spawnpoiint im looking forward to the complete review youre the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer ive seen one thing id like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen ideally a sidebyside in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer dont know if thats feasible for you in any case thanks for the work and enjoy,positive

gotta love lenovo got the ryzen 5600h version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and i couldnt have been happier it was 700€ in italy at the time paired with my wacom cintiq and a ram upgrade its been the perfect little gaming and digital painting set up,positive
people have been going crazy for the gigabyte g5 kd going for a relativelyaffordable price for an i5 11400h and rtx 3060 would be cool to see you guys buy and review it to see how good it is,positive
lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market my first introduction to pc gaming was a 1080p lenovo with sli 750ms was a killer deal too back when the 7 series was nvidias newest line i remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before i got it i havent gotten anything lenovo since as i build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops but i will always appreciate and respect what lenovo does,positive
nice definitely a great value i still have my old lenovo 960m 4gb gaming laptop i never upgraded it from 8gb of ram and that wouldve been an easy move for more performance now it doesnt make sense as i upgraded to an alienware with a 3080 and 32gb of ram but i still sometimes fire up the lenovo to see what it can do in 2022,positive
i just bought this today on best buy for 570 dollars love to see your making a video on it,positive
recently bought a lenovo legion laptop for 539 on ebay 4600h 1650 ti 8gb rams and 512ssd never been happier lenovo makes the best bang for the buck laptops also they aren’t to flashy,positive
i got an older version of the ideapad gaming 3 with a 1650 but with a ryzen 5600h and a 512gb ssd its an amazing laptop but i bough it at the time last year for 750 not a bargain but a well balanced laptop for work and gaming,positive
i have the model from 2019 mine has an i79850h and a mobile gtx 1650 this is a great machine aside from some plastic chipping due to the lid being opened and closed it annoyingly was 1300 with discounts,positive

never thought id say this but i got my ps5 today its absolutely breathtaking,positive
truly excellent overview concise and informative i genuinely feel better equipped to make my decision regarding the playstation 5 after watching your review appreciate you and your consistently fine work,positive
just stumbled upon your channel after successfully ordering a ps5 yesterday through sony direct the anticipation of it getting delivered made me want to watch some unboxings and reviews i came across your channel and immediately clicked because we have the same last name which is neat haha i actually really enjoyed your video it’s informative offers great insight and very professional while maintaining a personal creative nuance thank you,positive
i got the controller alone for use on my pc and im shocked that it works so natively well of course none game that i know of uses the trigger gimmick but the soundvibration feedback works like a charm sure it does require some set up but it works,positive
i honestly think marques should start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will do being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense would think he doesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition,positive
the controller really is the coolest thing about the ps5 astro’s playroom is insane with the haptics,positive
can we take a moment appreciate the level of effort norman put into this video the research facts analysis and narration are top notch i love the visual aspects like magazines figures gone box art and trinkets great job norm,positive

i’m in my earlier 40s i’ve found it difficult to go back and still enjoy many of the games from my youth but super mario world still holds up i think it will continue to stand the test of time with the ageless gameplay and level design it’s a masterpiece,positive
a fantastic and well made documentary that truly made me feel like a kid again i could feel my 5 year old self anticipating this 16 bit treasure as you were describing the build up to mario worlds launch in america i havent truly felt that way in a long time thank you i think i am going to go play some mario world now,positive
first allnighter i had was with a friend playing super mario world will never forget it seeing the artwork in the instructions book that came along brings back so many memories remember how awesome it was when you first discovered the sta rroad the top secret area in the donut ghost house the music in vanilla dome or valley of bowser damn it i wanna play now,positive

the fake slide is unfair to the defense you pursue that and get penalized as a defender,negative

polamalu jumping over the line against the titans is extra smart because he knows that even if hes too early its a flag but just half the distance to the goal theyre already so close to the goal line that it doesnt matter,positive
in case you’re wondering why the clock didn’t stop at that obj play the rule states that if you aren’t gaining yards while going out of bounds the clock keeps running this is a great example of obj he can’t just catch but he can run throw kick you name it,positive

greatest come back ever  although cory deserved to win ,positive
coby always deserves a second chance,positive
this quickly turned into very possible moments,positive
some people are not only incredibly talented they work hard on their skills and perform what seems impossible stephan curry and tiger woods come to mind right away both work incredibly hard in practice and alone as well,positive
054 best teammate in the history of the world he jumped off the bench and was cheering way before the ball went in,positive
550 that man knows what he just did was impressive as hell he deserves to feel proud for that,positive
110 love the inevitable evan longoria clip but right after that is the volleyball player going into the stands to keep the ball alive i’m surprised that they allowed that ,positive
i loved that you added volleyball in this compilation more less popular sports need recognition like cricket dodgeball and badminton,positive
incredible performances i just loved all the scenes shown just marvelous,positive
i swear every half court shot when the time ends is epic,positive
an amazing performance definitely maguires best performance in a united shirt,positive

i’m not a united fan but when i say this game gave me chills it reassured me why i watch the premier league,positive

i played on the field for number 31 i was in the australian juniour league world series team and had alot of memories come back to me from looking at the scenery,positive
1442 this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses this ones just different the game was over lol its not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown the game is literally over all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and thats it the washington wizards were up by 3 at that point even if the apposing team has time to foul you you hit just 1 free throw and its over even if you miss both they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to tie the game in an impossible amount of time long story short that throw lost them the game after ot lol just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history,negative
910 the game was almost over and was a blowout at that point dallas 52 buffalo 17 yet check out don beebe still giving 100 effort after the game bills owner ralph wilson walked from the owners booth to the locker room and thanked beebe for the play,positive
being a packers fan i remember watching that game against the seattle seahawks where hassleback said they were going to score in ot and when al harris picked him off and took it back i remember my family and i was jumping up and down yelling and going nuts one of my favorite sports moments ever especially with my favorite team being the ones offering the karma back at hassleback,positive
d hop breaking his ankles literally was by far the most savage,negative
success is the best revenge my dad used to say and its true,positive
pujols and trout taunting with the bow and arrow gestures was priceless,positive
440 isnt even the whole story the last time giancarlo stanton faced fiers he hit him in the face ending his season and prompting reconstructive surgery thats the reason he and now many baseball players wear face flaps on their helmets the very next time they face off he hits him again even if unintentional thats nuts,negative
this is unreal congrats on doing this at such a special place,positive
dude they actually got jim nantz to announce it legendary,positive
i was watching this with my dad and he didnt believe they were actually at the masters its crazy great job to the editors the team and bryson big achievement to be able to play at one of the most prestigious places on earth,positive
i feel like most people watching this video have 0 idea how unbelievable it is that they were allowed to even be at augusta before the masters let alone play all sports golf there,negative
it’s always a blessing whenever they decide to play everybody’s favorite battle another round of all sports golf,positive
this is the greatest video ever made  well done dude perfect bryson the full team,positive
as much as i love seeing these battles i think the guys should change the frisbees to the disc golfing frisbees they travel farther than the regular ones,positive
awesome video thanks to the masters management for allowing this great way to keep those youngsters involved very generous from the masters as always all class,positive
i attended the masters on thursday and the woods on 15 was a great place to stand for a while so many golfers ended up there and got to see them up close what a fantastic experience,positive
this arsenal side is proving itself very nicely playing with a lot more fluidity what a signing gabriel has been for them,positive
arsenals attack is so fluid and theyre playing so well man theyre fr looking real dangerous this season,positive
all game the fans were loud and behind the team especially the saliba chant this team is different and they’re together coyg,positive
it’s such a shame that the gabriel jesus goal was ruled offside he’s playing out of his skin at the moment and deserved that goal zinchenko played amazing today marteneli and jesus are always a threat and xhaka has been playing well consistently under his new role and ofc we gotta talk about saliba so young yet he plays like a veteran special mention to ben white who’s also been playing good at right back,positive
3 wins won’t guarantee us a top 4 finish but it’s better than 3 defeats which is where we were last season,positive
its great to see arsenal win the games they are supposed to win excited to see them against top 4 competition,positive
watching gabriel jesus in this team right now honestly puts such a huge smile on my face him and odegaard just fit so well together and the interplay between them and the wings is just so fun to watch finally happy watching arsenal play again,positive
compared to the same time last year i feel like im living in the cloud 9 3 games 3 wins 9 points 9 goals scored with only 2 goals allowed can you believe that for ones like tierney tomiyasu and smith rowe who were main starters for arsenal last season we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by i hope they can be patient grab the opportunities and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on compared to the last season this is a huge improvement the squad depth is so much thicker that we are using tomiyasu smith rowe and tierney as substitutes hopefully next week i would like to see vieira to make a debut even if its just for 10 or 20 minutes,positive
arsenals got 3 gabriels and all of them have been phenomenal,positive
tears in my eyes i prayed for these times of having a solid team,positive
2 32 what is even more amazing is that he used the support of his opponent’s shoulder to facilitate his own rotation in midair i didn’t see it the first time either,positive
113 that was the best golf shot ive ever seen,positive
i want more of these videos in my life so enjoyable to watch sport at its very best,positive
114 no sport event anywhere in history can come near this one god himself,negative
the last one wasnt great its a foul in footballing terms and always results in a yellow card other players have done the same and been booked for it too as did henry in that last clip,negative
only a 5 hours after the game was over this time that’s record speed good job guys,positive
that diaz goal was reminiscent of his wonder goal vs peru in the copa amer in fact he scored like that a bunch of times for porto too class player,positive
credit to crystal palace that was a great counterattack before the goal reminiscing of brentfords 4th on saturday,positive
that luis diaz goal is an instant classic as a colombian i could not be happier ,positive

milner was all over the pitch this game this man still has it,positive
i love luis diaz so much what a player what a character,positive
as a neutral fan i’m really happy to see both zaha and diaz scoring both top tier players in the league,positive
luis diaz has a big heart sharp teeth and an amazing attitude for liverpool sweetest of goals,positive
luis diaz always showing great character and ready to sacrifice anything for this team ,positive

plant and canelos postfight talk is honestly one of the best moments ive ever seen great stuff before the bell in the ring and after the fight,positive
canelo and plants speech gave me the chills man he was truly sad he lost the fight,negative

115 made me laugh way harder than it should have,positive
i love how at 2 minutes the thunder happens and the pitcher just drops everything and turns around like nope im gonna dip yall have fun,positive
im amazed at how players are able to react in the moment in ways that seem superhuman and then sometimes they dont even react as if it was special,positive
dave winfield of the new york yankees accidentally hit and killed a seagull with a baseball in toronto vs the blue jays august 1983 he was charged with cruelty to animals and an autopsy was even done on the seagull it created a lot of controversy here in toronto,negative

the jags v texans one always kills me the db did exactly what you’re taught to do don’t go for the int just knock it down much more effective than trying to go up with an nfllevel receiver just so unlucky lmao,negative
very entertaining one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected i remember my wife was given a free ticket to a diamondbacks game which went zerozero so she finally left and when she came home she said i got bored with the game the diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left winning the game i teased her endlessly after that suggesting she should not attend more dbacks games and they went on to win the world series that year my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the yankees and luis gonzalez base hit that won the game i met joe montana and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl and i saw the ending in french in montreal in 90 during my flight from sfo to toronto and the connecting flight to montreal our air canada pilot gave us updates on a onesided blowout i also will never forget the stanfordcal game in 82 and the play when cal beat stanford and the band became part of the game some still argue over two of the lateral passes but the win for cal was as it was and i still say that is among the craziest moments in sports history my own crazy moment was when i was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team even though i was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team the school we played had no players above the sixth grade so i agreed we won the game though i had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game adrenalin had me psyched and our qb said i threw perfect spirals i would intimidate the bigger players since they feared id plow under them and stop them from getting to the qb and they never did he was not sacked our team went on to win the norcal championship undefeated in our twelve team league my brother playing as wide receiver though i no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders i never went on to play in high school feeling i was too small to be as good as i was in my grammar school game where i also played on the defense and i stuck to distance cycling and golf both of which i enjoyed and also had many crazy moments and i was decent at the 440 as it was then now the 400 meters even in my early 60s now and despite a leg i broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago i still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing on my channel here cactus521 i even have a video of me jumping off the vegas stratosphere tower when i was 52 though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered i felt peace and not fear on the way down choosing that vs skydiving as my free fall bucket list item since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane ,positive
you know it’s a good game when there’s 20 minute highlights,positive
kevin de bruyne is insane newcastle need to be taken seriously this season,negative
saint max on his day can break down any press man incredible so fun to watch definitely one of those “streets will never forget” kind of players,positive

emotional day havent seen a newcastle side play that well against man city no less in a very long time gutted but grateful to get a point in the end just a heroic team performance could single every player in the starting xi out for praise just so proud of all of them as for city ill just say i clapped as soon as i saw de bruyne had played silva in on goal just phenomenal football i mean at times during that match it was terrifying when city had possession a wonderful side and a wonderful manager,positive

just saw duplantis won the olympics hes definitely a legend making all those jumps to the gold medal not a single fail,positive
fastest red card the only world record i could achieve,positive
the world record that i remember with pleasure is the first in a total of 11 of federica pellegrini in 2008 she was unjustly disqualified in the semifinal of her favorite race the 200sl so the next day she made the 400sl record in her career she also made a couple of records the same day but the first was particular,positive
one of the best races i have ever seen,positive
the longest shot has won the kentucky derby gives me chills and make me smile what a quote and a race,positive

in all honesty this might be the greatest kentucky derby victory of all time the longest shot passes the favorite right at the end you can’t write a story better than that,positive
i can’t get enough of this race the way he says “rich strike” in the end is legendary…,positive
that friggin horse looked like a running back cutting back and across midstride breaking for daylight then breaking it open to the end zone awesome display of athleticism horse and jockey,positive
it’s such a treat seeing spectacles like this good for rich strike…even if this horse does not win anymore rich strike is in the history books,positive
rewatching this and watching rich strike the whole way knowing what’s about to happen and hearing the announcers reaction i got chills up and down my spine what an unbelievable race,positive

aaronson becoming a star is awesome to see as well as marsch’s slap handshake at the end,positive
hopefully we stop hearing about how much trouble leeds are in without raphinhaphillipsbamford i love all 3 but we have replaced them well,positive
it’s crazy how nobody has mention how big rodrigo been these past games he is an amazing player before the prem and he is finally showing his potential that he had since his valancia days,positive
i’ve been a huge aaronson fan for a while now dude is an absolute lightning bolt and refuses to quit every time he plays for usmnt he provides a spark glad to see him doing well,positive
very impressed with leeds united so far love how aaronson has no quit in him and has a lot of heart glad to see american players doing well in the premier league with aaronson and adams hope they keep this up throughout the season,positive
what a freaking start for jesse marsch and the squad lets gooooo,positive
might not have world class quality but they have world class commitment pressing and energy very fun and promising performance,positive
aaronson is a must start at the world cup,positive
finally maguire used in a brilliant way what a game for harry ,positive
god bless ten hag finally mu has a manager with balls i pray he gets time to implement his vision and philosophy,positive
3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this liverpool team but the early indications are that the liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources as a long time lfc supporter i cant help but compare the decision to let sadio mane go to the same situation with xavi alonso some years back i think that j klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year hope i am wrong but if i am being honest man utd should have been 40 up at halftime,negative
they missed manè and nobody wants to admitted sorry,negative
martinez is all of 64 in his 59 height a giant among giants,positive
three weeks in and the table is unrecognizable,negative
i’m not over excited because man u usually turn up against the big teams we are good at counter attacking but against teams that sit back is when we struggle,positive
love that rashford didn’t make that first question about himself knowing he hadn’t any goal contributions in the prem in months he put the club first class ,positive
if liverpool dont sign at least 2 players midfielders before the transfer window closes making top 4 will be very difficult and as for vvd looks like he is getting too complacent this season,negative
perisic has brought so much offensive danger to the wings for spurs which is deadly considering someone of kanes quality waiting for those headers,negative
not that impressed with how spurs are controlling a game but thoroughly impressed by their resolve and determination every game so far this season they’ve faced stiff competition and they keep rising to the challenge it’s awesome to see no matter where they go,positive
really good response in the second half have to start games better if we want to win against the better teams though,positive
wolves are so close to being a top flight team however glad to see spurs come out on top,positive
i feel as though spurs is not overwhelmingly great compared to other top teams in bpl but what makes them so deadly is their continuous pressure and effort which shows around 2nd half,negative
as a sad wolves fan im actually encouraged by how well they played after this start though im already scared,positive
fun fact17 more goals to go and harry kane will become tottenhams all time record goal scorer jimmy greaves 1st with 266 goals kane 2nd with 250 goals,positive
the play at 1206 suprised me hopefully jimenez regains his confidence and plays like this more,positive
i like coby’s attitude even though he fails a lot he’s always on the positive side keep on going coby,positive
ty is phaenomenal every time i think no way he is finishing the last one but he really thrives under the pressure his mentality is outstanding but regardless of the outcome each and every video is a massive team effort ,positive
whats most impressive is how the editors managed to extend a 3 minute song into 11 mins without sounding boring,positive
ive literally watched this dozens of times over the last 4 years its one of the best,positive

511 combining the joke with cody’s laugh makes this amazing lol,positive
congratulations dude perfect for reaching 100000000 views,positive
de bruyne brilliant as always nice to see haaland can get the assists as well as the goals,positive
it’s crazy how much haaland can affect the game even with few touches his runs are always pulling players and opening up space for city to play once they start getting used to him being there for tap ins too it’s gonna be even scarier,negative
kevin de bruyne world class as usual haaland shouldve at least gotten on the scoresheet if foden squared him in but at least he got an assist he can still find a way to contribute without goals,positive
that first half was a masterclass by kdb and that goal using the outside of his foot was terrific,positive
foden cant do that bs that was a tap in for haaland,negative
adam smith should have been given a red card,negative
if i was haaland would have been pissed at foden too,negative
honestly you can’t even be surprised that bauer acts the way he does he grew up bullied by kids and adults who always told him he was nothing and worthless that shit stays with you,negative
will you make people stop cheating no alright then im just going to openly use the method of cheating and tell anyone and everyone,negative
as someone who was bullied heavily as a kid i can see theres a few outcomes of that sort of situation and one of them is people become complete antisocial assholes like bauer,negative
he literally said i’m going to cheat too if nobody wants to stop everyone else he was the one who made it so public and now we have umpires checking all the time,negative
mlb needs more players like bauer he’s entertaining and makes watching the game fun,positive
0457 i did this playing soccer for my high school during a game very memorable and always fun to think back on,positive

liverpool is such a disappointment even scrubs like man u can get the better of them smh,negative
hate these stupid zoom conferences,negative
congrats winnipeg open and jr open programs,positive
i hope they keep adding sports always had a blast with boxing,positive
this game looks fantastic it originally seemed like a barebones sequel to the wii games but its shaping up to be a really fun experience character customization tons of modes great music and visuals online and free updates im happy hopefully more sports will be added beyond golf id love to see baseball and boxing make a return,positive
this game looks great i cant wait to play it the badminton especially looks like it will be a lot of fun and the survival bowling is such a cool idea will definitely be buying this when it comes out,positive
when it comes to in game customization i go crazy for it so far from what i’ve seen if that in this game i’m super hyped,positive
i absolutely loved baseball in wii so i hope it comes as a dlc since golf is coming i really hope they continue adding sports,positive
it’s crazy how this is my mostanticipated game right now i always wanted a more fleshed out version of wii sports and this looks to be it hopefully we get some of the resort sports added later on,positive
i mostly want this due to the customization i would love to see some nintendo themed outfits in the game maybe as prizes for online events it would be cool to wear splatoon outfits or dress up as mario characters for example,positive
would be cool to see more sports getting in the game via updates would love to see waterpolo surfing kayaking as water based sports ice hockey skiïng and snowboarding as winter sports but also skating skateboarding basketball baseball as more summer based sports i could see a very special potential for other uses for the leg strap like keeping in balance in surfing and snowboarding making a triangle shape to break in skiïng and do some tricks like flips in skateboarding,positive
one of the biggest things i had against this game was the lack of miis but its nice to see that theyre here i will definitely buy this game,positive
i hope they add more sports i feel like a lot of the current ones are pretty similar so it would be nice to see some new ones come in,positive
that girl chugging the beer is pretty loyal lol,positive
love it i just could not stop laughing,positive
i cant stop laughing with all those cute animals on the field ,positive
zach hample eating it is classic hahahaha,positive

i absolutely played with utah in video games what was lebron talking about the 9798 jazz were unstoppable in video games,positive
218 someone needs to take that glove away before he pokes an eye out,negative
thank you for the lack of basketball highlights,negative
loved the season opener look back as a kid who went the games with my pops he worked at byu his entire career 40 years always had season tickets my dad passed away last october with a long painful battle with cancer with all the ugly evil things going on on the world byu football basketball was our time to just hangout and enjoy being together although my dad was a little to crazy dealing with traffic and parking ,positive
team jesus  comment down below if your on his winning team ,positive
finally finally a properly done highlight video no annoying commentating and no useless history on the players or the plays play after play after play awesome job,positive
the simpson flip really is incredible looks like something youd see in a movie about someone gaining super powers and taking advantage of it by playing football,positive
i’m not a golf fan but that putt is one of the most impressive things i’ve ever seen in sports,positive
i thought i was going to end up skimming or closing out this video early but this video was very well edited i was hooked on each play back to back without feeling bored the audio also was well balanced too and didnt have to worry about the next play being too loud or too soft just like what drummer386 said a couple months ago awesome job,positive
also the missed free throw by steven adams to get the rebound and immediately know where westbrook was to pass it to him was amazing he knew exactly where he was and they were able to get a shot off from the miss before the other team even knew what happened lol,positive
has one of the most incredible plays in golf ever commentators wow… nice,positive
336 never gets old the very definition of situational awareness,positive
that forward flip where he partially vaults off the other player is amazing even if you could practice for a thing like that itd still be hard to pull off,positive
doesn’t matter who we buy at this point once they’re here they’ll regress beyond recognition,negative
i think casemiro is a quality player and a quality singing i don’t believe he’ll be ‘unmotivated’ because he’s won everything he’s a world class cdm which we need but it’s madness that we’ll be paying that money for him at this point in the window crazy it reeks of absolute desperation,negative
quality player is casemiro also a dm which weve cried out for the concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at madrid we are said to pay him an eyepopping 400k a week is what ive heard thats typical united one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable unmotivated players who we then cant move on when its time as i say quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but wont helps us achieve anything substantial as for pulisic ive always been quite underwhelmed by him albeit you can see he does possess good quality i probably wouldnt be averse to a loan though it cant be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping rashford does anything productive every week,negative
the reality is that when he was at ajax ten hag didnt choose the players at ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players at manchester united,positive
we are a absolute mess if casemiro was the target why wasnt he signed 2 months ago we just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man im not saying casemiro is a rubbish player he is quality its just man utds approach to signings is a joke plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week but ill literally take anything over scott and fred,negative
casemiro would be a fabulous signing for us i can’t bear to watch mctominay play again,positive
united have 2 big transfer problems right now 1 literally everyone in football knows how bad the situation is at united and it means alot of good players are simply going to refuse to go here regardless how much money we offer them haaland is a good example 2 the players we can get the clubs they play for know how desperate we are and are naturally gonna jack up the price to get as money money as possible,negative
west ham look terrible thus far graham potter is doing incredible things at brighton,negative
brighton is the team people are actually sleeping ontheyre in a good standing at the moment but nobody is paying attention,negative
dont sleep on brighton i would like to see them in europe one day,positive
brighton looking good even though they lost couple good players,positive
moi and pervis and hopefully if sarmiento picks his level up i hope these three ecuadorian men play together they sure will do a high offensive playing style,positive
brighton doing everything right very good team,positive
probably the best game ive seen from harry maguire in a long time his absence from the game was pivotal in uniteds win,positive
ten hag was on the pitch 45 minutes before the warmup placing cones and balls in precise spots his body language was full of intensity and concentration he looked like a man on a mission,positive
this is a good coach hes clearly a floor general and knows how to drive results this is the guy you want you to lead your team especially if they have been so illdisciplined like united has for the last few years if this was basketball he is the type of point guard you want hes got excellent standards and definitely the mindset of a champion,positive
as a liverpool fan i have to say that i admire how ten hag approached this game he is great to listen to honest and intelligent not afraid to leave out some big egos for the greater interest of the team respect,positive
ten hag has found the best position for maguire not a single forward passed him not a single mis passed ball not a single foul not a single defensive error leading to goal keep it up maguire,positive
so refreshing to have a manager whos not afraid to make big decisions,positive
the tactical position of maguire was class ,positive
i loved ten hags comment the other day about he has always had slow starts at every club he managed but he always got the job done he has total belief in himself it showed on the pitch last night that the players have belief now too,positive
ive been down my whole life and now look at me now look at me now god those words tears are speaking,negative
that “look at me now” gave me chills it really shows what he has been through to get there big congratulations,positive
“look at me now” what an iconic speech the whole thing,positive
the most amazing thing about this is how leon shone on the mic hes never been regarded as much of a talker but this might be best post fight interview ever its got it all cold one liners tear jerking passion a roaring crowd and bedlam in the stadium watched this so many times already,positive
so many people said edwards didnt even deserve the shot most underrated most disrespected fighter in the sport casuals with opinions baffling look at him now leon edwards is the quintessential gray man dark horse he does not train at altitude and epo dope so the altitude really affected his output throughout the fight the headkick was well read and calculated incredible,negative
every time he says look at me now i feel it happy for him ,positive
leon has done the uk proud all the hurdles he’s had in his career all the doubters and to silence everyone and beat the p4p number 1 was great to see ,positive
this has me hyped for work about to clock in and scream “you’s all thought i’d be late look at me now” congrats leon,positive
the name “rocky” couldn’t possibly be more fitting absolutely amazing win faced with such adversity,positive
its amazing how arsenal is finally playing so well they dont have to rely on running the game though saka saliba jesus and zinchenko are also such a fresh injection to this team,positive
can we get a second season of all or nothing with arsenal i would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes,positive
xhaka as a player summarizes arsenals rebirth absolutely love that we kept him,positive
tim howard just keeps getting better and better as a pundit wasn’t impressed by him at first but he’s slowly growing on me,positive
for once in a very long time it feels great to be a gooner,positive
the fans support of saliba is unreal going back to the own goal last week the whole fan base wants him to succeed he could have an amazing career,positive
arteta finally getting some credibility if partley stays healthy and jesus keeps his form arsenal can challenge city for the title,positive
the result is better than what was expected arsenal are performing better than anticipated the next actual challenge is villa not man u,positive
can we get a second season of all or nothing with arsenal i would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes,positive
arsenal haters you didnt beat anyone and it is only 3 games into the season also arsenal haters last season you were beat by a championship team and have lost all your three games you are staring at relegation ,negative
such an awesome collection of cars for this year’s car magazine sports car giant test – but which is your favourite comment below…,positive
a collection of brilliant cars but i would go for the gt4rs you cant beat a high revving normally aspirated engine,positive
gt4rs with the mclaren a very close second for mei simply believe the porshe is way more versatile and at the same time affordable too whilst putting the same smile on my face,positive
great video guys this channel definitely deserves more subs than a lot of other car review channels its the gt4rs for me here with the 296 a close second,positive
well done car magazine but i will take porsche state of art on wheels,positive
wonderful group of cars i would have a tough time choosing between the lotus gt4rs i thought the color combo on that ferrari was in poor taste it does not look good to my eyes,negative
i feel like the 765 doesn’t belong in this list at all almost unfair,negative
id love any of those with the exception of the lotus in this company it looks outclassed in every department for me the one that offers the best combination of performance desirability and of being obtainable would be the maserati,positive
how gorgeous is the mc20 in comparison to the 296 i love the rear 34 of the 296 but its just ugly from the front the mc20 with a mc12 livery would be my choice i think would need the opfs removed though to get some better sound out of it or the lotus and pay off my house p p,positive

impossible not to love mitrovic he plays with so much passion,positive
two teams with two classic cf players strong physical and dominant in the air great match premier league needs more strikers like mitrovic and toney,positive
mitrovic just sores up on headers it’s nearly unstoppable for smaller players,positive
fulham could easily stay up along with forest,positive
first goal for brentford was a masterpiece loved it mitrovic is a killer,positive
everyone doubted fulham but they’re looking favorites to stay up,positive
ivan toneys mitro celebration probably a lil awkward now,negative
as a spurs fan congrats fulham and i hope you play another priemer league next season to survive,positive
he’s playing in goal for my team any day however many legs he’s got i don’t care i love this man,positive
that one legged goalie is teaching us more than any other video on youtube,positive
the vasy clip was a normal game for him thats the big cat go bolts,positive
that 1 lag man  absolutely legend hats off melt my heart,positive
really awesome moments great video,positive
we were doing backhans sweeps in waterpolo when i was in hs nothing spectacular other than we were strong,positive
333 as per george carlin i believe that shot is worth 25 points,positive
the cyclist was incredible made me jump out of my seat,positive
gabriel jesus has seriously fit into this squad like a glove two goals and two assist is amazing saka looked a bit quiet today but it’s probably due to his fitness not being up to speed this early on zinchenko did good and marteneli fried fofona who looks like he’s about ti go for 80 millif we get another signing i’ll be happy this team is looking very promising,positive
love the start of this season so far arsenal need to keep their confidence up in order to take control over games and win them coyg,positive
you can still see how saliba is solid even after the miscommunication mistake what a gem,positive
the fans clapping for saliba after the own goal said it all for me the fans are behind this group great win the score line could’ve been much higher coyg,positive
gabriel jesus has been amazing for arsenal hes merged quickly into this arsenal side playing magnificently arsenal by the looks of it have a good season ahead of them,positive
the chemistry and youth of this arsenal squad is crazy top four finish this year and if they improve even further then theyll definitely compete with city and liverpool next season,positive
xhaka had a really good game criticize him when it’s justified no doubt but you also have to praise him when he deserves it goal assist,positive
gabriel jesus really showing pep that they didn’t need to look for anyone “better” he’s pure class at any club he goes to,positive
will be interesting to see how far arsenal’s defense will take them this year they have plenty of offense,positive
i love how the arsenal fans applauded saliba when he scored an own knowinng that if that ball goes beyond him to vardy it is a goal best fans in the pl,positive

the humor logic and writing of nerd explains is just top tier easily the best of the how to beat youtube posters,positive
i mean to be fair stomping on their hand when they try to make their presence known peacefully only to get shanked in the eye through a peephole a while later does indeed anger anyone not just smart fish people,negative
actually if its currently september 1914 and he left 67 days ago that would have been a week or two after arch duke franz ferdinand was assassinated and an englishman like friend wouldnt have known a fullblown world war was about to clack off since austriahungary wouldnt declare war until a few weeks until after he set sail,negative
im still amazed that the dude somehow dodged a world war by fighting a fish army,positive

the respect he shows every ingredient is amazing sushi is part art and part food in my eyes every step is so precise,positive
im never going to attempt to do homemade sushi but loved watching a true master of his craft do it,positive
taka might just be my favourite chef that’s been on this channel which is impressive since i have many other favourites he’s so engaging and i felt so welcome to try out what he’s teaching us i’d love more videos with him,positive
such elaborate techniques ive been trying to make rolls for a while with not much success theyre delicious but unsightly lol and it will be very interesting trying to recreate at least some of these,positive
ive seen a lot of content on sushi making and eating over the decades and this was by far one of the most profound and stuffed with knowledge great content even though the closed captions apparently didnt know what a sinew is and made it a sinu whatever that is,positive
perfect timing just tried making sushi for the first time last night,positive
happy sunday everyone after finishing my living room makeover to wanted to go over some common living room design mistakes i see and how to fix them i hope this gives you some tips and ideas you can apply in your living room,positive
i know i love mismatched furniture one of the ways i’ve been looking to accomplish this is by using slip covers amazon has some great ones with a variety of colors and patterns and very affordable ,positive
love your videos kristen so brilliantly put together and such a lot of fantastic tips thank you very much ,positive
hi kristen in your videos youve talked about grounding your furniture by using a large rug which looks great what if i have carpet is there anything i would need to incorporate to make the furniture appear grounded in this situation ,positive
i would love some tips to decorate a small but high ceiling living room its been a struggle to find inspiration,positive
hi kristen i love your design tips my husband is insisting on getting a recliner sofa can i mix them with fabric accent chairs and do the furniture in the living room have to be of same height,positive
love the advice you give this is something i need to do in my living room nice work,positive
love your contents will definitely consider your tips in my room design journey thanks a bunch,positive
great video as always loved the tv nestled within the gallery wall good idea also i love every opportunity to look at your living room you did a fabulous job on that room one of my favorites,positive
kristen youre like the only youtuber i constantly watch i feel like i connect with you in so many ways,positive
hes right ive always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and i come across as confident most of the times to the point where people are surprised when i tell them i have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do its not about feeling perfect its about knowing you deserve to be where youre at and accepting that you might feel uncomfortable at times,positive
i think fake it till you make it is really important when it comes to confidence you need to practice it in order for it to start coming naturally appearing confident even when you dont feel confident i believe can prevent confrontation or becoming a victim in some circumstances,positive
honestly i feel like confidence comes naturally when you care about something so much that you are no longer sensitive to how people see you and how you appear in front of others like jane goodall or colin powell im a person that has a mission thats important to me plus huge experience and knowledge that built me and im proud and what the world thinks is not my concern,positive
confidence can be very quiet finally someone said it thank you,positive
i was born confident and as a little girl i was constantly scolded for being too bold or outspoken now i own it again and found joy in life like when i was true to myself,positive
the presenter here delivers his knowledge succinctly he is the example of what he is teaching thank you for a concise no extraneous lesson it is has been immensely helpful,positive
i have adhd so usually its hard for me to focus on talks speeches and so on but when someone is really good at speaking and confident about what theyre saying i tend to pay more and even full attention i paid full attention to this video and even remember what i learned after watching only once this is my 2nd time here just to make sure i dont forget,positive
to me confidence means being happy with who you are having that inner peace with the person you are,positive
this guys body language tells me that he is uncomfortable with this interview and that he is withholding information,negative
he’s definitely someone who can make you admit everything just by his personality,positive
im glad that those signs he laid out at the beginning were myths ive put so much effort over the years into avoiding showing these signs by accident so i dont come across as untrustworthy and when i do them by accident i always felt like im somehow maliciously deceiving people or myself without knowing about it this puts my mind at ease selfsoothing if you will,positive
god his children must’ve had such a hard time lying to him,negative
the guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person they know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits and most importantly none of this can be used too convict you they cant just say yep hes the murderer he is lying and throw you in prison it is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too or who they should focus on they still need to investigate and find actual proofv to convict you if you didnt do it they cant convict you just because you seemed like you were lying,negative
this is the most interesting thing ive seen in a long time i can feel this guys passion and attention to detail the way he described seeing pertinent nonverbals jumping out at you as if a caricature when played at double speed was incredibly perceptive im so intensely interested in this individual and his affinity to human behavior,positive
my dad was a drill sargent in the army he had the ability to read peoples behavior like thisit was unnerving to have him explain my behavior to me,negative
i’m honestly starting to get the impression that being a french woman means putting 100 of your energy into being the sexiest woman in the room but then pretending you don’t try at all,negative
i lived 2 years in paris and i used to observe a lot in the metro their outfit i noticed that blue beige and grey were the colors most used to dress no patterns only simple color so simple and stylish at the same time it is the opposite of us italians we like be noticed by accessories or colors i prefer the french style,positive
i love what camielle said about french girls finding what suits them their body and what they like and dressing according to that not following trends but buying staple pieces that will fit your wardrobe and last a long time i really love that fast fashion has ruined our sense of style some people only buy a piece because its trendy then the trend passes and they forget about that item and throw it out and the cycle continues with the next trend,positive
“it’s nice to have a bag that doesn’t scream designer” well i have a wardrobe full of clothes that don’t even whisper designer y’all it makes me so happy that i made you laugh ,positive
i bet a lot of french people are rolling their eyes at this,negative
i love how they are like actual friends talking over each other interrupting each other not listening the little laughs i love it,positive
shes so on point with french styles they dont follow trends but stay to the classics with some accents of edginess or accents of new trends but the root is classic and simple,positive
this girl really has an aussie feel to me funny that she’s britishfrench which you can see in ways but so much of her reminds me of my australian friends,positive
always good to hear your thoughtful and logical analysis i dont care about bullish or bearish market trade a small percentage of your portfolio rather than going in and out every couple weeks trying to time the market trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 84 btc when i started at 3 btc in just few weeks implementing richard and tips,positive
this was a fantastic talk its a topic we are all somewhat aware of but we need to dive deeper like this individual thank you sir,positive
very well put i love how ted talks are short but convey meaningful messages,positive
030 true in college i wrote a 25 page term paper and in error turned in the draft with a bunch of typos grammer errors run on sentences spelling errors etc the first couple paragraphs were fine so when it got retuned it was graded a with a good work handwritten by the professor obviously and luckily for me he didnt bother reading past the first sentence,positive
this was great i am a freelance content writer and ive been implementing these strategies from the beginning because its very true great talk,positive
nicholas carr described this scanning vs deep reading phenomenon in great detail in his 2010 book the shallows what the internet is doing to our brains and is worth a read for anyone with further interest and he provides provocative evidence it changes the mechanism our brain uses to process and store information,positive
that hit home im so guilty of spending hours writinganswering emails etc with what i would think makes me sound strong intelligent and a force to be respected and would read them back to myself countless times to see how good l lookedl loved this talk and will totally change now kiss keep it simple stupid,positive
being succinct is great now how long will it take for you to learn that people dont appreciate being mislead or flat out lied to do another ted talk when you figure that part out side note youve known this information for a long time this is why the most important information is buried at the bottom the media uses it to their advantage which is why in most cases the first half tends to be pointless and boring or aimed at narrative people stop paying attention so never get to the actual information,negative
i dont have time it is not a priority time is elastic time is a choice totally agreed thank you so much for the talk,positive
this is hands down one of best talks i have heard thanks for such a wonderful lesson,positive
well i have finished watching it and i found it really useful here are some lessons i learnt i dont have time it is not a priority time is a choice it is elastic we have enough time almost all of us make the experiences enjoyable such as you can read or listen to a book while commuting get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis focus on what matters and you will build the live you want,positive
make yourself a threecategory priority list for the coming week career relationships self and there should be 23 items in each category small moments can have great power you can use your bits of time for bits of joy even if we are busy we have time for what matters quoting her,positive

every minute i spend is my choice how great is this sentence,positive
i love this womans attitude shes funny captivating and interesting too for me step 1 of controlling my time would be to stop watching youtube though,positive
i know at least 5 ways to deal with them 1 never take their words personally always have this suspicion in mind that they do not wish good for you so you shouldnt trust their opinion of you 2 dont compete with them it is futile and drains your energy 3 if they attack you stay calm indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment the odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative 4 dont become them if they are negative be positive if they lie tell the truth if they speak behind your back speak to their face always lead with example because they might not simply have the skills to do that 5 do not trust them dont tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you keep your distance and value your boundaries protect yourself,negative
repeat after me its safe to set boundaries with difficult people no matter what they say or feel i am safe,positive
this only works if all people involved are reasonable if one or more parties cant be reasoned with then the problem continues you can communicate until youre blue in the face but if the other person isnt willing to communicate appropriately then youve hit a brick wall,negative
their bad behavior shouldnt be the cause of your heartattack brilliant,negative
cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level people who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them money unfortunately office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded they have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem best solution is to remove yourself from that environment,negative
this puts a whole new perspective on the way i think about others actions and my reactions i cant change people but i can change the way i think and feel and also asking questions is another good point very well said,positive

how to raise a successful kid without over parenting make sure they understand that life isnt about high grades and a big bank account make sure they understand to grow up kind and compassionate happy and making others happy,positive
my mother used my “successes” as her gauge to show approval and basic humanity it was never enough for her to show love only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that i was a complete failure take it from me don’t push your children towards your goals it only teaches them that they aren’t good enough to make it on their own i was “successful” in school and was the first in my family to get a degree but i was also the most miserable sad child of all 10 of us kids is that success i know it isn’t,negative
we are imperfect people trying to raise perfect children go figure,negative
im crying so hard my heart aches because i feel the pressures of the children from narcissistic parents who control their children too much and destroy their self confidence this speech is a breakthrough thank you i love this,positive
my parents used to be like that then when i got into the perfecte degree in the perfect college i had a breakdown that left me bedridden for a whole year they realized what had happened and now they are being absolutely amazing understanding and encouragingbutnotoverbearing parents to my little brother and to me as well i love them so much and i respect and admire them so much for havig the courage of admitting their own shortcomings and to truly rethink their parenting style to become better for their kids ,positive

one thing this video misses and probably the one most important thing is that confidence comes from within you can stand in any way you want dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king solomon blush but if inside you’re still insecure the world will see it love yourself know you’re worthy and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside don’t try and be or imitate someone else be who you are and love it one thing this video gets right know you’re gonna be ok no matter what ‘nough said love to you all xxx,positive
you reach true confidence by letting everything go,positive
if you spend time getting to know yourself and learn to love and accept that person then you strengthen the most important relationship of your life the one you have with yourself if that relationship is solid then you always have an inner safe haven no matter what is going on around you that self love and understanding allows you to stay true to yourself in every situation that is the deepest form of confidence,positive

one of my favorite cakes my mother ever made started out as a near fail it was a cheesecake that had cracked down the middle we had blueberries growing in our yard so she took a bunch that wed already picked cooked them down into a thick jelly and poured it into the crack as i recall she called it grand canyon blueberry cheesecake,positive
the pool cake was so cute put an appropriate toy depending on what character your child is currently obsessed with im 20 and i would still absolutely love to get a cake like that,positive
as soon as hyper realistic cakes came up my first thought was sideserf i love that you made sure to point out that she has problems with her videos being stolen and uncredited to spread the word to new audiences its why she uses the fluorescent green icing now i love watching all your content but it just mesmerises me when you bake 3,positive
just woke up at 6am nothing like an upload from ann to start off our fridays the effort you put into every single video you make is just chefs kiss easily the most informative and creative baking channel i know and it goes so far beyond that as youve shown time and time again,positive
the transformation of these cakes are mind blowing,positive
ann im so glad you stepped in to be the aussie mum the world needed have you ever thought about doing an episode on traditional australian bakes like lamingtons anzac biscuits pavlovas etc theyre good recipes for new bakers also maybe find an old cwa cookbook and follow the recipes especially when australia still had rations,positive
imagine being ann’s friend that’s already a treat i couldn’t imagine being sick and her being her amazing self by delivering a delicious cake to mei hope your friend is feeling better,positive

the movie explains how to kill him you need to make him be afraid you what ever he turns into you need to face that fear and fight back once pennywise realises that you arent scared he will begin to starve because he feeds off of fear once he starves and is weakened you can finish him off for good,negative
laughter defeats fear it would have made more sense in the remake if instead of bullying and insulting it they start laughing at how silly and not frightening the clown really is without any fear it gets weaker and weaker until it finally shrinks down to the bug it truly is,negative
so im watching this for nostalgia reasons i still love this series,positive
the reason why pennywise said fear when he was defeated is not because he will spread more of it its because he is feeling fear and he let go for 2 reasons so he can go down to his lair and because hes in shock,negative
im not entirely sure of how i stumbled upon this channel but as an avid hunter of moviecomic book lore this channel is absolutely amazing kya is such a legend the level of passion she demonstrates in these videos is real and her narration is superb i am very thankful for the fact that this channel even exists 55 liked and subscribed,positive

i’m in a transitional phase of my life at 51 and bevy’s talk was just what i needed,positive
in the most perfect timing this came to me i am certainly at a point in my life where i’m choosing me i’m rediscovering what i love and advocating for myself and making choices without regret it’s liberating and as always a journey of unknowns but i am certain that i will live my life and not be miserable,positive

ddoi is such an educational channel without him humans would never grow thumbs,positive
1 honey pot ants are also delicious or so im told 2 the extraction of those cactus peppers is downright horrifying in the trypophobic sense yet i am still curious as to how they taste,negative
the way that kid toss the chalk away when he finished writing is golden also a dragon fruit is the fruit of a cactus plant prickly pear is also another delicious one,positive
the duck going for a swim and the service dog pushing the wheelchair are the cutest things ive seen all day,positive
for those wondering the way how honey pot ants get their abdomens so big with fluids it done by feeding a freshly emerged adult ant tons of food while their exoskeleton is still soft this allows the gaster to stretch bigger than normal leading to how the ants become so plump they do this because if a shortage of food comes the other ants can get it from the ants that store it in their large abdomens called repletes it really is fascinating thing to see happen,positive
as the pinned comment already said i think this was one of your coolest videos it had a lot of weird but cool and fascinating clips i really enjoy watching your content,positive
the fruit from the cactus is actually pretty decent it’s been a few years since i’ve last tried it but sometimes it can be kinda tangy if i remember correctly,positive
ddoi never fails to impress me keep up the great work,positive
in this day and age my life has become complicated especially my social and digital life i always wondered how to simplify it somehow thank you for making this video,positive
“very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking” marcus aurelius meditations,positive
the biggest thing ive realized lately is that the more money you have the more money you will want to spend so you never really feel like you have enough thats why i really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have this is especially true of us in the first world we get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff that they are living the dream but the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles and if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach the irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most they have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need so when they come to live here and get a job they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money but the family doesnt realize that the cost of living is much higher where we live you never feel like you have enough,positive
perfect video as always ez in todays day age every person needs to remove excess baggage from ones life and embrace the idea of simplification both sense and simplicity are the two most significant aspects of our lives,positive
i just love how this video is an amalgamation of all the past videos you have produce so far thanks again for this wonderful food for the thought eizelgänger ,positive
thank you einzelganger for these mentally nutritious videos that you make for us to feed our minds peace,positive
good summary when i crave something i imagine as realistically as possible that i already have it this helps me know if i really want it,positive
that last point is really true its not about simplifying all aspects of life just for its own sake rather the point is for a more tranquil life thanks for the video,positive
i love your channel the technical details are perfect i’m an engineer and i work with batteries as a hobby there are two kinds of batteries that are lion one is “protected” and the other is “unprotected” the protected ones prevent overcharging and overdischarging as well as over current the unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection guess which people choose for their vaping lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density they are damaged by over charging and over discharging cheap chargers don’t behave and will over charge few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge so why don’t people use protected cells generally those have too low current to make vaping possible the current draw to instantly heat to 200c is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in causing things to not work or work much more slowly,positive
crazy how this series went from kinda lightheartedly debunking ice cream icing and coke watermelon lifehacks to discussing about actually lifethreatening stuff thank you ann youre doing amazing work 3,positive
they removed the trust verification by removing the dislike number from being seen yes i get all the arguments of why they did it but people can watch a video to see if the dislike ratio is justified and read the comments to why the dislike was made its sort of like reading reviews on a product you are purchasing,negative
i remember when vaping was purely prescribed to recovering smokers 10 years ago my friends mother had a vape that looked exactly like a cigarette and was recommended to her by a proffesional now i see middle schoolers sharing them in the parking lot of the school,negative
making a separate comment for this one thing you didnt mention in the exploding vape part of the video is counterfeit batteries you mentioned faulty batteries poorly designed vapes but i think this is a big one that should not be left out most people who vape seek out batteries from known reputable brands however theres a huge problem of cheap counterfeit imitations of those batteries being sold under the original brand name even on places like amazon amazon have a huge problem with counterfeit products being sold through their website and it has really tarnished their brand in many peoples eyes,negative
a shame how quickly vapes went from a better alternative to cigarettes to public heath hazard and under scrutiny,negative
pov when people wants the face but they dont have enough robux,negative

it looks weird to me to have the whites be so smooth and perfect this method seems to preserve the whites the best although it requires more water and vinegar than other techniques ive been using alton browns technique and it works better than the classic vortex method but this one looks even easier,positive
ooh outsciencing heston cant wait to give this a go for lunch tomorrow i really like the concept and how practical it is for preparing large numbers of eggs,positive
great tip ive added vinager to the poaching water and when doing multiple eggs used rings to hold the individual eggs in place which can shape them kind of ugly into rounds compared to yours ive used small tuna tins that i cut the top and bottom off of for this pre soaking in vinager is much smarter too,positive
i already am comfortable poaching an egg i even own egg laying chickens but i am so happy and excited to try this method you are absolutely right i have seen tons of poaching videos and this is a unique technique,positive
so wonderful cant wait to try some perfect poached eggs soon ,positive
ill remember this for the next time i host brunch for a large group there are tons of great tips in here to help get a lot of eggs on the table at the same time if youre only making three or four eggs this method seems like overkill i add a few tablespoons of vinegar to the simmering water and crack one egg at a time into a ramekin so that i can very gently add it to the water as long as the eggs are fresh it works every time,positive
incredible method after 10 years as a chef i thought i tried every way possible to poach eggs and this one is by far the best tried it this morning it works flawlessly 1010 thanks for this tip ,positive

if building a second brain sounds interesting to you and youd like to know more you can buy tiagos book on amazon here  or take it further and join tiagos building a second brain course,positive
this is one of the very best recaps of the building a second brain method ali fantastic job to you and your team  it was so much fun collaborating together and i hope we do it again,positive
summary notes 0000 intro the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information the second brain system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information the second brain system has helped ali in his own life and can hopefully help others as well the second brain system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations capture organize distill express 0041 what is a second brain and why should you have one a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you with inputting processing and outputting information the methodology for building a second brain has four parts capture organize distill and express code 0456 c capture ali discusses different ways of capturing information both manually and automatically ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts 0832 o organise ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning this means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed this system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts 1107 d distill ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important different than highlighting were used to in school its not particularly effective for retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important 1145 e express the e in the second brain system stands for express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless its important to find a way to share your creativity with others 1309 how my second brain has helped ali the coursebook has helped ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one most of the work is already done the system has also helped with his teaching work he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information,positive
i am eagerly waiting for alis first ted talk it would be amazing i wonder what topic he will speak on,positive
having a second brain is no joke i am currently using notion to perfect this great video ali definetly devouring all of the information you are putting out ,positive
now this is my favourite video i have been struggling a lot when it comes to handling multiple projects thanks ali you really answered a lot of my questions today,positive
im so happy about this book im reading it right now am on page 90 and its already changing my digital life thank you tiago forte ,positive
thanks for this ali and team it really helps break down the process of thinking to have a 2nd brain ive been calmer with my projects since listening to you and i grow ever more productive with my schedule and life in general as for the video idea perhaps you can make a video on how to deal with burn outs i believe burnouts burn creativity you want to push but you just mentally cant ive dealt with it in the past but im getting out of it now since the company i want to work for actually hit me up to work with them it gave me a boost,positive
your book club series is one of the most useful series on youtube i have a commonplace book in evernote and im always amazed at the gems ive come across over the years you spinning around by a hot tub when you were talking about selfcare is such a vibe love the idea of organising ideas according to actionability felt called out by hoarding your ideas thank you for this breakdown of the book ali noted as a must read and i also need to work expressing my finds,positive

to absorb what one reads its crucial to master concentration when i started reading in my early youth my mind would wander before finishing a page over time my concentration improved to a point where i could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought activities like chess reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration i know a buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment its a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline its literally rewired his brain schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning,positive
i was born into a relatively poor family never had the opportunity to go to college i became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school i happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the us i would go to the university library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught within 18 months i had the knowledge of an mba by the time i was 20 i started my own company and was a millionaire before i turned 40 it took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you i finally found a banker that would talk to me i explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money i would borrow he was floored,positive
be a teacher but forever a student listening in itself is a lost art so difficult to run across a good listener joe rogan comes to mind i really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with elon as his guest i dont necessarily agree with elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts what i like about joe is he gives his guests time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs or agenda like so many on the tell a vision being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort,positive
the most important thing for learning like musk says is understanding the fundamentals of whatever it is you want to understand always always always build a solid foundation and then everything else will make perfect sense,positive
i love elon he makes it cool to be smart hes a genius,positive
the saying goes “ a jack of all trades is a master of none but still always better than a master of one” so arguably elon is a good example rather than proving it wrong,positive
as an undergrad i had to take history and im an mathscience person who hates history on my own i learned to rearrange stories in my head to make it make sense to me i would exchange real people with people i knew to relate to the topics i scores a hundred on about every exam when most were struggling the nstructor made a comment that it was one person who always scored a hundred they were like who who because theres no way his tests were long when i told them what i was doing to remember the content they laughed but i was like it works and believe it or not i still remember most of it and that was 22 years ago,negative

i think one of the greatest losses to history is that most people think egypt and china are very far from each other yes they are quite distant and it would take an individual months to do it but it wasnt an individual it was a series of peoples just because they didnt have planes or the combustion engine doesnt mean people werent crossing continents not a person or persons but people your friendly neighborhood druid,negative

love the breakdown ive gradually built my finance and made my first 100k through investing which ive used to start my jewellery business and with what i’ve learned over a decade investing given enough time solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out so the onus is on newbies to beware having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out,positive

the recent content feels better than ever before and the frequency of uploads is just perfect can see how much work is being put into this,positive
the video is great especially when you talk about the agency business model although i disagree about some other business models generalizations for example on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once its an option theres revenue sharing pay per sale etc from dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle costumer the margins game is highly variable and thats where some people get ahead of others nevertheless selling roi services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency website content and all,positive

isnt it just glorified fashion illustration essentially these are 3d drawings thats it actual fashion and the beauty of it is conquering your fashion sketches conquering your elaborate ideas by overcoming physical obstacles that is one of the main reason we love fashion to draw an haute couture dress is somewhat easy but to make it is beyond hard making a dress is a journey for all the people involved that is how innovation happens these animated pieces remind me the 80s licensing craze or something of sort it is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money it is not the future of fashion it is just a new market for fashion to expand silly gimmicks bringing big buck thats about it,positive

love the breakdown i started my first business from money i made off dividends with what i’ve learned over a decade investing given enough time solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out so the onus is on newbies to beware having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out,positive

the ‘offer to work for free’ thing is surprisingly rare but great advice i took a gamble and emailed a company i covered in my psychology bsc to ask if i could come work for them for free and they gave me a paid gig as a trial 16 years later and i’m now managing director in all those years not one person has attempted the same thing,positive
love this video as someone who is currently working in a generally gigbased industry im always looking ways to create some passive income that i can always fall back on and this was a very well thoughtout and informative video thanks ali,positive

look man you folks have changed my life ive been struggling to make my design business profitable for almost a decade and because i couldnt figure it out myself ive been being employed by companies that dont serve me or my wallet ive been living short of my purpose and i knew it i have been watching this channel for 3 weeks and i have already started networking smarter charging more being more aggressive with my design style and approach i feel confident and you chris do have given me that as a creative i dont know if ill ever be able to thank yourepay you but know that you changed a mans life with what you know thank you so much and keep building the future,positive
this was amazing thank you chris love the emphasis on value and that the buyer determines it i learned not to waste time trying to convince someone to see value you can help them realize the value but you can’t force them to change what they value that’s a losing game,positive
so glad this made it to chris desired metric im only 15 minutes in and have received massive value from this thank you so much chris i am still in the beginning stages of getting my photovideo portfolio ready but this massively changes how i think about pricing and will be extremely beneficial when i start to take on paid work,positive

i watch elon musk videos to grow back the neurons i lost throughout the day looking at memes,positive
for sure the reality business is hard and painful and takes a huge amount of effort if you want to build something great the best quote i heard was nobody is expecting you to do something amazing but it is amazing when you do something the reality is you might not build a multi billion dollar business that is global but you might build something that brings value and that is why we get into business to test ourselves our own ability and to be different you can only admire what elon musk has achieved and the potential of where technology could take us in the future,positive
i already lost a lot of money recently trying to pursuit my dreams its frustrating and depressing but elon definitely gives me hope and determination he is a role model for me,positive
great video but let me talk about something important i see many young and old make mistakes that i think should not be i believe that everyone young or old should have an investment plan that increases their financial returns from three figures to six figures the investment can be your retirement plan or future plan depending on what you want but what matters most is that you have an investment that is profitable,positive
if your customers love you your odds of success are dramatically higher great stuff,positive
at 224 elon says something quite profound entrepreneurs are born of everyday this resonates with me because the next big entrepreneurs are likely to be ordinary people with an innovative idea and a solution to a problem that people face everyday they are problem solvers its quite exciting to see fresh new ideas come to market and people starting new businesses,positive

wow amazing maxwell just gave away the secret to running a successful business i own and operate my own company and 95 of what he said is something you cant learn from school honestly well done,positive
first met max back when he was still operating out of the coffee stall hes a great entrepreneur and skilled coffee shop owner,positive
maxvell is such a great person hes very generous with his knowledge and experience and thats sadly hard to find nowadays hes also extremely capable business owner with amazing systems implemented in the business,positive

maxwell is an incredible guy i love how deep he dove into understanding not just coffee but the processes and most importantly customer experience what an inspiration,positive

i love this interview ive been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last 2 years we moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within 4 miles i keep telling people i know i dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said i should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church i was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time im scared to start even though i have a lot of support at church and friends one of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people but again my family is relying on my income to live i know it would be great i just need to find a person i trust to help run it along side with me so i can maintain my insurance career at the same time since its not demanding at all,positive

as you can see we are already in august and i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 92 btc when i started at 35 btc in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from liberton corp would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,positive
keep up the great work you are truly an asset to the community thanks for all you do i like your truthful coverage btcs price has been fluctuating lately buying isnt a tough call but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding the good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable most people do not understand how the space works your advantage in understanding chart wont guarantee what an asset is going to do prices will go up or down nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader libertoncorp i made 12btc from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market i’m still bagging more money,positive
honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 35 btc from day tradng with liberton corp insights and charts his been one step ahead of other analysisstick with btcethbnbadamatic,negative

high fashion is sometimes very abstract very elitist very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous but if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too you find artisans people who study and excel in a craft they deserve to be highlighted more behind that overpriced chanel bag is a leatherchainfabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion fast fashion is slowly killing our planet water consumption landfills toxic chemical dumped in village waters people paid pennies etc haute couture is rare it’s scarce i find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but i love my high end pieces that have lasted me years and will continue to do so behind these fashion shows are artisans that will always be better than any fast producing machine,negative
imran interviews the most powerful individuals in the fashion industry but i truly believe he holds just as much influence this series is exactly what the industry needs in terms of consumers listening and fellow designersindustry professionals taking note imran is the projector of those poignant words and as a collective it holds much greater power,positive
luxury fashion is one of the worlds biggest industries i think this is a great topic for a bloomberg series i would be interested is seeing more of this type of content i am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between gucci and balenciaga especially now that i know they both come under the kering umbrella other recent collaborations include versace and fendi which could be the subject of another video the more recent video in this series examines the chinese market and how fashion brands are now targeting young asian consumers,positive
the worst thing to happen to fashion was ‘influencers’ who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic they’re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same,negative
i love how “luxury” is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich like what really is the point here is it the small artisans who get and praise or the fashion “houses” and companies that actually get to design exploit labor and sell for profit  the definition just isn’t strong enough for me to care,negative
i used to love high fashion but the more i learn about what goes on in the industry the more i feel like pursuing a different career choice so much nepotism elitism and lack of creativity it’s almost as if you don’t fit within certain enclaves you’re not welcomed,negative
i love the new sustainability efforts excited to see new changes,positive
what annoys me the most is that these so called a majority of these high class fashion brands exploit their workers with long hours and little pay even though they are selling products for an extremely high price tag,negative
i switched years ago from fashion to reupholstery so glad i get to reduce reuse upcycle last of a dying breed 2 of the world do what we still do,positive
as a fellow asian i can confidently say that the rarest thing in this video was kyles beautiful stache,positive
back in 2017 i caught a 40pound king upriver along the klutina river feeder river to the copper river and it was one of the best days of my life that was a ‘reel’ workout,positive
i always enjoyed selling this product as a fishmonger it was something my guest looked forward to and i was happy to sell it rly is top tier fish and some i do quite respect,positive
so glad kyle brought up how important salmon are for native alaskan communities,positive
wish kyle and his crew all the luck to always bring home king salmon every time they go out to fish for it,positive
i was lucky to have copper river salmon once it was by far the best salmon i’ve ever tasted,positive
im really glad he acknowledged the indigenous traditions and food culture there are a lot of fishermen that dont care about preservation or morals,positive
its fascinating that a gill netted fish in an estuary not at the peak of their growth cycle garners so much money when compared to troll caught kings on hook and line when theyre still putting on fat that are treated immediately to ike jima processed individually and then hand packed on ice to get core temps down immediately,positive
i am happy for this dude he seem happy and humble i wish him nothing but luck,positive

despite the economic downturn im having the best time of my life financially earning over 83k in the last 2months with an investment of 19000 money can be made even in a bear market make the most of it,positive
my concern is that with the big players waking up to this business model they will muscle in easily and squeeze out these little guys who was doing well below the radar now that the cat is out of the bag their profitability will experience more headwinds going forward,negative
nothing brings me more satisfaction than efficiency to think about how all that merchandise is going to be resold and not go into a landfill makes me very happy indeed,positive
i remember watching a documentary about how the area of west africa had become a dumping ground for usedunwanted clothes from europe and the americas more specifically the north americas i was totally shocked and had no idea about this villagers would sometimes travel for several miles on foot sometimes with their kids to pick through this clothing waste to sell into their communities and earn money most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever,negative
i have yet to make a return to amazon that wasn’t damaged double shipped or not as described they could avoid a lot of returns by better vetting i also often select returned items if the saving are worth it so far no problems,positive
this is one of the coolest things ive noticed recently when ollies popped up in my hometown selling namebrand goods at a quarter of the original pricei knew liquidation stores would be the way of the future i love it it makes me happy seeing these goods find homes instead of ending up as pollution,positive
as a person who shops on the clearance aisles at stores im loving this documentary its an industry not many people think of on a large scale but definitely very profitable,positive
the only issue is that the majority of customers are resellers so most consumers aren’t getting the discount but either way it helps the environment which is great,positive
white dude creates black ai dude that was the first mistake,negative

imagine the terminator but programmed by a white supremacist then realize elon musk completely ignores racism at tesla and has turned into an authoritarian facist and hes creating sentient androids oh and hes a south african emerald farmer the republicans will just claim that the robots went crazy,negative
it’s about the money of course if an exec can “sign” a robot they can churn out crap 24x7,negative

the young queen latto delivers every time props to the artist but she’s going to make it sell capricorn energy all day my kids kids gone have they way on godgenerational wealth health wisdom overflow,positive
i loved this the flow of lakeyah is satisfying ,positive
latto and lakeyah have such complimentary flows and deliveries they are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat i think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab i hope someday i can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music truly unmatched energy,positive
respect to lakeyah fr she is truly flourishing and big latto killed her verse per usual 3,positive
the first thing i want you to knowwhom ever you might be is that god loves you i dont care what you have done in the past i dont care of the mistakes you have made the blunders we all have he loves you i want you to understand that millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn in just a few moments time if you believe it is all god requires believe it forget about your past when they put jesus in that tomb they put all of your sins in that tomb as well when jesus walked out of that tomb he walked out victorious and we came out with him a new creation in christ jesus i am going to pray and i want you to pray with me i am going to say the words that you need to say saying words cannot save you but if you truly believe in your heart you will be saved and i want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart and jesus christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life let us pray dear god in heaven i come to you i am sorry for my sins and the way i have lived the things i have done please forgive me cleanse me with your precious blood from every sin i have ever committed right now with my mouth i confess the lord jesus and in my heart i believe that jesus died for me and rose from the dead and i accept jesus christ this very moment as my savior my redeemer and i make him the lord of my life and right now i am a new creation i am washed i am cleansed i am saved we ask this all in the name of jesus amen,positive

i think this is very inspiring and a big shoutout to anyone who is brave enough to follow their dreams and pursue a career or lifestyle that isnt the norm ,positive
when can cbnc actually show someone who created something cool like a product turned business an interesting yt channel maybe they publish their own books etc rather than these woefully unqualified finance “gurus” who add more detriment than value to most of its customers,negative

i feel so fake wanting to make a business because i feel whatever i make has already been made and idk if it’s gonna be better than those already made so it scares me,negative
it’s so inspiring to new entrepreneurs to see others also starting their own businesses good luck to anyone who’s opening their first business,positive
the detail and thoughtfulness some of these people put into their packaging is just insane obviously whether the product itself is actually good is another matter but just the sheer creativity beauty and detail in the presentation would probably make me wanna order from them again even if the product itself wasnt anything super special that kind of packaging makes receiving the product an experience like getting an incredible delightful present i would be smiling like crazy and squealing with delight as soon as i open a box like that would probably make my whole week these people are so cool and i admire and respect them so much,positive
just gonna add some positivity in the comment section by saying i’m so proud of of these people with their small business im personally too afraid to start my own business not yet at least but these people just straight up sent it with whatever they got lol i genuinely wish all of them to do well ,positive
i’m 12 as well and i was inspired to start my own business by these tiktoks i started painting custom ordered seashells i’m so happy with how my business turned out d all i did to figure out what i was going to sell is i went around my room five times with my eyes closed and what ever my finger landed on i sold and it landed on a seashell and that’s how my business started i would really recommend starting your own business as a past time it’s also a great way to earn money and allowance as a kid and it’s so fun to do i really enjoy it it can be stressful at times but it’s so worth it d,positive
i feel like small business owners like put their heart and soul into their packages and try to get it shipped in time but they still dont get appreciated for their hard work,negative
the package look more expensive than the actual product,negative

wow  just finished your tutorial it took me somewhere between three and four hours to go through it because i stopped it all the time to try out almost everything you had just presented in order to remember things better and while doing so actually discovered a few more things i also appreciated some of your design ideas which further opened my eyes to the endless possibilities canva offers i had already watched a number of other tutorials some also very well presented but most are way too short they just awaken your curiosity but then leave you hanging there struggling after having worked through your tutorial i feel that i hit the ground running and am now off to your other tutorials to learn more having come down with covid fortunately not too bad i still have a few more days of quarantene left that i will use for studying and practising more ,positive

most logical and very easytounderstand course content his way of explaining is incomparable to anyone in his profession and the topic is covered vividly and never feels bored i gained so strong knowledge immensely in a tiny time hat off to the professor youre the great teacher to me i ever had in this field sir best wishes for your future tutorials and life as well,positive
excellent practical course for someone who knows only the very minimal basics if that well modulated and articulated designed for adult self learners easy to follow and it is a plus that you did not use techie language your presentation style made it easy to follow without distractions real life examples are a plus application of knowledge always enhances learning looking forward to your next course,positive
im about 30 minutes in and i gotta admit you are brilliant at organizing what you want to teach youve managed to organize even zooming in and out at specific intervals to teach all those small aspects of the program really cool i never knew excel was so intuitive either,positive
this was an excellent class well done in organization methods and process there are lots of tools out there but this class is better because problems are solved as examples are worked out in this way it keeps your attention while deepening the learning,positive
one hour into this video and i have learned more about how to use apis and postman than i have with tons of other videos combined i cant see how video instruction can get better than this all the money i have spent to learn this and actually understand it and this video instructor provides the most precise explanation i have seen to date excellent work,positive
there is so much thought process and hard work put in by the content creators we need this kind of content more so that students feel more confident learning newer things i have become a huge fan of the channelhats off to you guys keep doing this great work,positive
here i am employed as a developer watching a video that purports to be for beginners and its a great video so far one of the things i love about approaches like this is that especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks for instance i know what statelessness means generally but then at around 2330 craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the contextwith no extraneous details nice work,positive
you guys make learning fun the fact that you went over apis in a broad sense and not just webbased really nailed home what an api really is wow,positive
im enjoying your tutorial a lot but a side note i think its recommended to invoke pip as python m pip because it is more portable having recently had issues due to windows10 and trying naively to just invoke pip on its own i thought it would be worth mentioning especially since this is aimed at beginners who might struggle with issues like that cheers,positive
this was truly a whirlwind introduction to apis i believe it was a little more harder for me as i havent started to learn java yet still learning python but none less this is an extremely well done course thank you craig for your work and i will now take another rest as ive reached the end to unscramble my brain,positive
this is easily the best course in this section hats of to this guy didnt feel like boring bombarment of information enjoyed every moment of it,positive
such an approachable manner of teaching craig thank you even as a refresher for me i just felt compelled to keep listening through am sure this has been extremely useful for introducing newcomers into coding no end,positive
i havent finished yet but wonderful explanations and great examples so far with teachers like this learning is a joy,positive

i just want to say that in my job i write sql coding every day and i’m branching out now learning c just as a hobby currently and this video is seriously one of the best instruction videos mike is awesome i wish he had a followup for teaching advanced c i just love his way of teaching it’s excellent precise not overly wordy and simple and the best thing is he runs his query after every example so we can clearly see the output seriously he is the best great speaker and presenter edit just a note but mike even explained loops which also occur in sql and it’s something i honestly haven’t ever really fully grasped before but because of this video i finally get it this actually is going to positively effect my job too not just my hobby just wonderful teaching,positive
great tutorial its hard to find someone who explains the basics as well as touching on more commonly used variables also thank you for leaving in your mistakes it helps knowing that experienced programmers still miss common mistakes,positive
i needed to learn something about c in a hurry my first thought was to seek you out again as expected you were clear and concise and made it all so easy you are a superstar,positive
this was one of the few programming videos which i completed fully thanks to mike for explaining each and every concept crisp and clear eagerly excited to start my journey in programming,positive
you taught me more in 4 hours than my professor did in an entire semester,positive
dude i dont know if you know but this tutorial is one of the cleanest concise on youtube the way you get to the point and explain well in brief manner makes learning c seem intuitive i know this is just the surface but it is presented in a way that makes it feel breezy and effortless,positive

i’ve done some sql database management in a gui before but learning to do it through a terminal has been awesome i would love to see a part two going over primary and foreign keys and database relationships the way you format your videos is great for learning and i love it thank you so much for the content you put out here’s hoping for a part 2,positive
i learned more from this video than i did from an entire semester of a watching paint dry intro to databases class thanks chuck,positive
yes please chuck make more videos about sql you read my mind i just started to make a website with flask for python and a sqlite3 or mysql database thanks for the new video,positive
1948 i understand that this is for beginners just starting with sql but in my opinion you should always delete with unique value like id in this case because later youll probably have more than one jeff keep up the good work,positive
just wanted to add that having strong knowledge of sql and databases in general is extremely helpful for developing queries and detection rules using tools like splunk spl or defender kql great video please get in the weeds,positive

i love how having grown up with games im just taking these systems for granted and remember being annoyed with some and instantly engaged by others without knowing why either i have just been ignoring the obvious to not ruin the illusion or well im just not very good at reflecting over my hobby xd at any rate thanks for a very informative upload hail the shadow cabal,positive
john romero used to say that the first level in the game was the last level he designed by that time you already know what the whole game is going to play like and you can use that knowledge to weave it all together seamlessly it works perfectly for somewhat simple games like commander keen and doom and id like to think that it still works for more advanced or narrativedriven games thoughts,positive
just the sight of a portal test chamber brings me joy,positive
its amazing to me that guild wars 1 had such an incredible tutorial island so much so that people spent years min maxing and living in it as a main point of playing said game and never leaving it for the pure enjoyment of it,positive
while it is a good idea to seamlessly blend tutorial and initial gameplay i still have a soft spot for stuff like the hazard course in halflife which is an inuniverse training grounds for people to get familiar with the hev suit and in turn the game and its mechanics,positive
honestly i feel like the most important option with a tutorial is the option to skip it entirely for replaying purposes and the option to revisit it at any point in the game,positive
one of my friends gave up on monster hunter rise because he got overwhelmed by all the mechanics you can interact while having pretty much 0 tutorials especially how weapons work and which are their movesets as a veteran i really no longer think about that but it reminded me how not having gradual introductions to the main mechanics of a game can turn many potential players away,negative

if u ever feel useless in life just remember there are idiotic fools that dislike a 6 hour video of a man teaching how to use python for absolutley free,negative
after 25 years i am returning here to say that i’ve just accepted a job offer for a good salary and my it journey started here from this video in november of 2019 this was my first source of information when i got back from work being a cable tech and typed “python full course” or something along those lines of course back then a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me and this video perhaps wasn’t the most beginner friendly however i was so sick of my job and i absolutely saw no growth in doing cable where the salary cap for a technician was probably it jobs base pay for the most part so i decided to google every single thing i don’t understand and i successfully changed careers,negative

gordons solo cooking shows are awesome his videos look kind of complicated but theyre really pretty straightforward and common ingredients i feel dumb for never using a neutral oil grapeseed while grilling a burger that with the seasoning steps makes all the difference,positive
gordon ramsay is a wonderful person a master of his craft,positive
he explained all the stuff in one hour which my school been explaining since 4 months respect sir,positive

i love how brad actually understand what an inch is in meanings of hair 6 months ago i had my hair down to my waist and asked to get 3 inches off my hair he cut off 8 inches and it looked absolutely horrendous i asked for layers and he gave me the choppiest hair you will ever see i cried for 2 days straight and went to school in a ponytail for 2 months,positive

brad i dont know what you look like but im sure you look incredible me laying in bed at 3am with dorito dust on my face and hair unbrushed thanks brad,positive
i’m really proud of the way that she took notes literally her hair looks adorable on her this is a great style for her the color is really pretty for her complexion even though she may need to do it one more time to hit all those spots,positive
my toxic trait is watching these and immediately saying “yes i must try this now” it turned out great i think wavy hair is so forgiving every time i cut it myself hehe,positive
i just did my daughters hair and omg we are both loving it she has curly hair from being biracial and it works so well for her why didnt we do this earlier,positive

i am a retired hairstylist and your videos are very entertaining i did that same haircut back in the 80s on myself and others it was not called the wolf cut but was called the farah worn by the actress farah fawcett from the show charlies angels i see here it has made a comeback,positive

its cool that both editions have there own features to themselves java with timed combat slab crouching and crawling and bedrock with crossplay potion cauldron armor stand arms and some other stuff that i forgot,positive
i found a really fancy simple and inexpensive chair design you put down a slab on the ground a door on the back trap doors on the sides and of all things a sign post above the slab on the door now this works best with two different wood types but it still looks really cool warped for the sign and slab look best for me also does anyone else see spiders in the black and red tericota or nemo fish in the blue orange taracota might be a story telling ability there might be fun to explore,positive
the darker wood underwater technique also works well for showing stepped on vs unused stairs for instance and for paths across rock substitute cobble and gravel to show the wear,positive
not gonna lie gordon ramsay seems like a nice guy teaching us peasants how to cook,positive
i love how he teaches the right timing to turn the food i usually end up burning it because im afraid of undercooking so its great to get these pro tips,positive

i love that the narrator is particularly enraged at the horrific cheesecake tutorial usually the narrator performs with an impersonal almost inhumane robotesque anonymity and objectiveness but here you start to see their own real personality come through just a bit whoever they are they must be an avid baker to be so enraged by the british womans baking faux pas hahaha,negative
as a person living in the uk i can confirm this is an isolated incident i just put the biscuits in a ziplock bag and beat the crap out of them with a rolling pin this lady made me facepalm so bad,negative
damn the cheesecake proved the narrator’s not just a robot capable of occasionally trying out products he showed actual emotion past making a bad joke followed by “i’ll see myself out” kay you’ve done us a great service demonstrating genuine emotion in the be amazed narrator xd,positive

the last two years was also the worst time to buy real estate its met it bubble peak though and will take some time to resettle,negative
homes are being way overvalued time for sellers to come down to reality,negative
this painful plateau of economic misery will continue for years there are too many forces propping up the market itll never get back down to the average person anymore because the institutional money will grab much of the property before it does there are also so many more options for homeowners than simply selling now sideways for years to come and the next generations go downhill hopefully it was worth the greed of the asset bubble the fed created,negative
not a great time for buyers right up until prices crash and blackrock comes in and sweeps em all up on the cheap in cash homeowners that cant pay an absurd mortgage can rent for exorbitant rates after they boost the prices back up you will own nothing and you will not be happy,negative

the two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence chernobyl and 2 natural disaster fukushima as a british citizen i would say that on the most part we are very capable of preventing those two things we’ve wasted 30 years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion let’s get those plants running baby,negative
i think anyone who has spent time working in a modern agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant we no longer plan past the next quarter supply chain bottleneck is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict cerveza the system is brittle by design because its so much cheaper that way nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos its a huge engineering lift it takes 20 years to pay itself off you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts machine them weld them then certify and maintain them over a period of 40 years instead weve been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home gutting workforces funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain skill loss as the old timers machinists retire but hey we delivered a lot of value for shareholders and now the chickens are coming home to roost,negative
excellent video marko things look really bad for now just recently it was reported that germans among many others probably already spend their savings to fight inflation instead of having their salaries rise to cover it i dont want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase or when those savings run out,negative
great video again marko you did a great job  sadly the netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos  in addition i can tell that after the fukushima nuclear incident in march 2011 the eu banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second chernobyl incident the thru regulations coal was stamped as dirty and gas was the second best option after nuclear power if we go back into history the north european countries the netherlands also build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages since there wasnt a need to change and gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created now there is need so the coal and nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need from my point of view these things should change nuclear is the way to go create a military security perimeter around nuclear power plants the western world shouldnt be working with russia nor china for energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability furthermore the ecb cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0 intrest rates the financial unstable countries you call them pigs portugal italy greece spain and with this structural inflation problems russia knows this and the ecb messed up big time last but not least the eu but also the usa canada australia and japan need to stop applying qe start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable thanks again marko,positive
hi marko im living in the germany not born though and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis honestly as a european i feel quite disappointed by everything i understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after fukushima accident but on the other hand i cannot understand how they didnt invest in other resources or should i say how the europe especially germany didnt diversify when it comes to energy suppliers its like you said they just ignored that fact even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with russia,negative

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 12 btc with 21 btcfrom day tradng with jacob carlson insights and chartshis been one step ahead of other analysis you can reach mr jacob carlson on ͳeiєɠɾαmjacobcarlson10,negative

i can hear the we want ratcliffe chant as a united fan a selfmade working class roots billionaire who lived 8 miles from old trafford supporting united being a united owner you couldnt write the script its unbelievable,negative
if mu fans really want the glazes out you have to hurt them where they care the most money boycott the club commercial sell and their sponsors lower their tv broadcast viewsstadium attendancesocial media activity ratings etc all these together will brought down the valuation of the club really weaken the glazess position and help potential buyers protest along is meaningless before that i doubt anything will happen,negative

funny enough the argument that bitboys business is advice is incredibly dangerous for him coming from someone who is actually registered to give financial advice there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice and what you can say if thats your business needless to say bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front normally youtubers are protected from liability because their business youtube technically isnt advicebased admitting your business is advicebased though might open you up to liability im not a lawyer but i know a bit about the legality of financial advice happy to touch base if it would help,negative

hey erling paralegal here i saw the end of your video but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit lawsuits are not fun in any way unless your the attorneyfirm and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress my parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always moreover if the other side has an attorney they have the advantage of knowing how the system works such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase rule 26a dislcosures interrogatories evidence you intend to use at trial depositions of plaintiffs defendants and expert witnesses etc and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge i truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself just be careful with how you proceed pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done also remember its a legal system and not a justice system this is not legal advice just a concerned fan lawyers or other legal professionals please correct anything i may have overlookedunintentionally misconstrued ps i think the service the guy who threw the papers at you rudely was fine unfortunately you identified yourself once that happens they can just leave it at your doorstep,negative

he always sues everyone hes a well known scammer who gets paid to promote crypto scams hes got a reputation,negative
can’t wait seeing him under oath asked how much money he’s taken to promote scams he’s digging his own grave on this one,negative

guy long term follower here and financial risk manager with 10y experience i think you missed with this video while i agree that the risks are certainly there given the government power and the fact current interest rates in china are far higher then the west they have far more room to manoeuvre them self out of this crisis great content as always keep up the good work team coin bureau,positive

great content i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 102 btc when i started at 35 btc in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from feven lena i would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,positive

high inflation was never a reason to sellthe definition of inflation is that prices go up versus fiat essentially logically that would make sense even for stocks but especially for a commodity thats been known for many years as an inflation hedge my growing love for crypto caused me to explore until i came across alice marcella although im trying to avoid sensationalism alice is by far the best no hype for hypes sake but great inspiration to trade crypto the market has been irrational for far too long what were seeing today is a small correction of the illogical selling pressure,positive

i have watched you for the past 2 years and found you to be really down to earth and no frills congrates mate and stay real and love the fact you share your loses and wins good luck bitcoin price recently completed a twomonth surge that resulted in a price increase to over 25000 consequently investors are now concentrating on the cryptocurrency’s next target price billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price particularly in the last four weeks the loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry i think the direction is upward movement with a bit of silence before the storm agree its boring for the past few days a good strategy for hoddlerss moving forward would be to buy now and trade not to just seat like a baby seater and watch and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn the rise will surprise everyone as for traders you make money anyways in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions if you’re a modern investor then your main aim i guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility well goodnews you don’t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with and trade with my investment advisor mrs robin moore trade signal and the rest will be a good history of profits for you as i have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 1503 btc with 309 btc with her trade signal despite the state of the market trading with her trade signal is a guarantee that profits are assured for helpguidance on buildinginvestingfinancial portfolio ͳeiєɠɾαm moorerobin or whatsapp 12132627458,positive

i live in the netherlands europe and got news for you we are already in an energy crisis gas price has gone 12x at the moment compared to prices pre covid that translates in 4x the price if you need a nrw energy contract so people here pay easy 600 a month instead of 150 euro but in 2023 prices are expected 800 to 1000 euros a month that means an insane recession you think the bearmarket is almost over think againit only just started,negative
in my younger years i guided flyfishing in alaska when looking out the window of the float plane sometimes i’d see ponds that almost looked like they were boiling it was natural gas coming up through the permafrost the arctic regions of europe have these same stores of natural gas they need to utilized as a measure of self sufficiency energy independent and security the idea they haven’t thought of this is crazy to rely on countries that harbor governments that brutalize their own citizens is not good business did you turn your back on the bully at school smiling and being nice is one thing but being in bed with evil is another,negative
the whole world is intertwined in this energy crisis thanks lark ,positive
great summary of europes gas crisis lark id say its going to be a rough winter for some countries but reserves of gas have been made and there should also be a plan for alternative types of heating like heat pumps which are much more efficient,positive
great video europe should also expect an extreme winter much like the extreme summer they have just experienced so the stores will definitely not be enough,negative

these are really tough times for the whole market most of the top coins are down but the token fans are still growing psg rbif sat arsand these are all very potential project that can be held for a long time to wc,positive
the reason the eu is so low has to do with the fact that countries in the eu such as italy spain portugal and cyprus since they still have large debts with the european bank can therefore not raise interest rates the countries can not repay their debt properly so that the debt becomes higher unfortunately these countries are still not doing anything in their country to ensure that their internal economies run better,negative

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 12 btc from day tradng with wtrade inspects insights and charts they been one step ahead of other analysis,negative
we have been on a recession since the beginning of 2022 but big media and governments all over the world didn’t want to admit it we need to be wise and use our brains knowledge is power and i’d like all the family to be powerful just purchased some amztc3 thanks for keeping us informed during this times of doubt,positive

i love the grounded reality of this channeli started in crypto in august 2017 and i bought ini was up 5x by december only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch the original investment go down by about 85 during the ensuing 4 year bear market i took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do i wish i had bought more i am in profit for now but i am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from dickson jenkinshave learned from you and other youtubrs especially my mentor dickson jenkins who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 2btc to 13btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and i know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past it is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research,positive
yeah ive been able to withdraw my initial investment and some profits from coswift arbitrage i still think this is still unreal though this wont last long term but at this point im making 3236 a daily if this doest go well ill be ok,positive

i must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space first of all youre just awesome ive been following for months now and the cinematic videos excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding before anything else i would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go but we can try to make predictions using past events i think prices should run up a lot now punishing panic sellers and forced sellers most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective everything has changed…we are in a recession facing stagflation rising rates and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof breaking consumers’ backs there are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market smart investors trade and take shortterm profits ive made over 11’ btc with 21’ btc retail trading not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market kyle miller i came across his channel where he shares his charts the selling fatigue will wane and the market will reset historically fortune favored the ones who bought in thought moments in moments of uncertainty when prices traded close to the 200wmayou can reach mr kyle on ͳeiєɠɾαm kylemiller3 cheers thank me later,positive

he said did and is shady and he got called out i love when idiots think they can no be held to the same bs standards,negative
this only means one thingpamp will go to the moon but for real it is good to see these guys get exposed by orhers in the community that means btc is losing ground and the truth eventually will come out,positive
crypto makes being a thief a piece of cake no government oversight you pump up the numbers on your wallet the value goes up up people think they will make a profit so they invest their cash months later the price drops the cash has already been transferred to an offshore account so long suckers,negative

the way you explained the psychology of each wave educated me so much thank you bcb have followed for years and you always bring value to the space,positive
i love how you do focus on more than just crypto two quick questions if we do start wave 5 any guess as to roughly what the peak would be is that the overall 4236 extension second what happens next if it hits that overall high i expect a crash but what if wave 5 doesnt get that high,positive
awesome video bcb thank you but what does wave 5 in the stock market mean for the alt coin market would we have enough time for eth to finish that fractal you mentioned the beginning of the super cycle also the merge is coming in a few weeks is bitcoin going up to 40k considered a retracement that we need for the alt coin season we all want,positive
what i love about you is that you never speak your bias as gospel you give everyone the freedom to decide for themselves without shoving your bias down their throats and potentially brainwashing them to think what you think you present each argument clearly and concisely i particularly love the breakdown explanation of elliot wave theory and what actually happens psychologically with the market participants well done brother have a good one ,positive
absolutely love the discussions about the stock markets your crypto approach is tied to the performance of bitcoin which is usually tied to the stock market your stock market analysis helps to solidify your approach to crypto keep it up,positive
amazing video just learning about the different waves really helps thanks for everything you do my dude helps plebs like me learn 3,positive
an updated price prediction would be good or confirmation that your previous targets for the alts are still in tact i’m presuming they are not but think it would be useful to understand what prices you are expecting if btc retraces thanks ,positive

i think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a depression so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new aths great points in your video i agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think btc is perfectly correlated to spnasdaq and altcoins to btc refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective so many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom that shortterm thinking is such a rookie mistake by dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guesswork out next bull runs it wont be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k what will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low im really holding on for this possible low point reentry i screwed up some time back i need this lower point to get back in i’ve small cash on the sideline i dont like that but i refuse to fomo in our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before my advice to them is this go all out into trading trading is where the bucks are been made i see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up traditional markets are getting recked the new economy is crypto not fiat people want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment advisor mrkyle miller with his guides and the trade signal i use in trading i have moved from having 58 btc to atop 173 btc in a short period of time invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader ͳeiєɠɾαm kylemiller3 for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with his topnotch trade signal,positive

great stuff elio am totally with you ty for the daily input you give us my specialty are gaming launchpads cos it combines defi nfts and metaverse and if gaming is the future and we dont know which projects will win than quality gaming launchpads are the best bet anyone can take no influencer covers this topic in great detail i have developed advanced strategies which work like a swiss clock all thx to listening to you guys and taking what works and discarding what doesnt too many people take you guys too literally there are just sooo many advantages to gaming launchpads over layer 1s and other projects i made a fortune last year with seedify and other projects now making amazing passive income during the winter times am focused on finding new amazing launchpads such as spintop spores etc anything with great teams vision and tokenomics just loving this bear market to the max 3 give me more,positive
no doubt the best bear market drinking game is taking a shot every time ellio says “the reality is”,positive
that was a good one i agree,positive
i like it when your videos have positivity and optimism everyone in crypto right now especially on twitter are ultra focused on the bear and further downward pressure like we get it we know it may come we may sink lower sideways whatever… personally i also have conviction and totally click with what you are saying about gaming i know the market will return but for now i am not interested in talking about price more so what is being built so many exciting projects like defi kingdoms star atlas and many more all building through the bear even your own projects id be happy just to listen to videos on what is going on rather than what the prices are doing,positive
the market seems really interesting now i think it may go even lower and ill accumulate some more usdt before that happens to be ready,positive

hi casey can i ask something please thank you for your great videos i was thinking about stablecoins do traders convert btc into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and buy back by converting back into btc is this what people do also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes thank you for any advice all the best kieron,positive

trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors its a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries for investors whats probably most attractive is the possibility of lifechanging returns dont worry youre not late to the crypto party were likely still in the very early innings leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market if youre new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert i have learned from alot of youtubers especially my mentor gerard mcdonald who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately,positive

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 12 btc from day tradng with wtrade inspects insights and charts they been one step ahead of other analysis,negative
thanks for the update i always appreciate the insight im really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long i had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video in as much i would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end if this is really a bear market rally then bitcoin is not done going down just like stocks are not done going down and if this isn’t a bear market rally and the fed achieves a soft landing bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now but we just have to wait and see my hope is that by the fourth quarter the economy will be slowing enough that the fed says we are going to pause and then you will see the next crypto cycle start i have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed imo please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year being a retail trader in the crypto market and implementing strategiessignals from eddie crypto a professional brokertradr that has been my mentor i have accumulated 12 btc in profits although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits people who are open to learning from history will survive it’s not that difficult you can reach out to mr eddie on ͳeiєɠɾαm his personal handle is edcrypto8 or whatsapp✙18053284321‬,positive

i sincerely appreciate the knowledge you share if you have been closely watching the crypto or even invested in it chances are that you are wondering whether the latest bear cycle is over the truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the longterm despite the heavy outflows bitcoin still managed to promptly recover this recovery demonstrated bitcoin’s strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery the obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy i have been trading with boston weber’s signals and strategy for 3 weeks which i have been able to accumulate 108 btc with his signals he’s a trader i believe everyone else can also work it,positive

thanks for all you do i like your truthful coverage mad respect for educating everyone btcs price has been fluctuating lately but i think we should be educating the newbies on what to do aside holding rather than discussing about the dip the good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable most people do not understand how the space works your advantage is understanding charts won’t guarantee what an asset is going to do prices will go up or down nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader ruby benally i made 85 btc from the recent crash in the market within a period of five weeks,positive

most people dream of having half your collection i love the vids so much im getting a 5x5 today,positive
3417 do you see it the big edge pieces which everything turns around are actually the centers the cloverleaves are actually the edges and for the corners half of them look like centers and the other half are actually hidden inside the puzzle this means you actually have to look on the inside of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there and that just makes it really hard,negative
your collection has been growing so much year after year it’s amazing,positive
this is a great review of what i missed when i stopped cubing for the past 8 years i’m back at it now thank you for the video,positive
i love octopuses no but seriously i remember him back in like 201517 when the end of the year would always mean getting my subscription feed flooded with cube collection videos nowadays it seems like you’re the only one who still does it i enjoyed every minute of this long video and i also salute how much effort it would’ve taken to solve all those puzzles,positive

the 251m is a great cube the newer versions which are one of the air leap or pro and the air has not as many features as the pro and leap and the leap just has bigger core magnets than the pro which can sometimes be a disadvantage i main the 251m pro with the default ges and set it up with 23 drops of dnm which stops most of the catches and lockups,positive

him calls a gan cube a regular cube me wait thats illegal,negative
ese cubo azul se mira que se ah de aentir muy satisfactorio girarlo ,positive
i personally love the look of stickerless they just look so much cleaner imo,positive
i really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect i have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes its very frustraiting,negative
it would actually be nice to have stickerless cubes reproducing the scheme of stickered cubes with black lines around the pieces this is the reason why i prefer stickered cubes the alternance between colors and black kind of like shadows make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool 3d aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself which with a stickerless cube is just not possible it just seems like one big cube do you know what i mean edit i guess what i wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which i don’t really like,positive
what i find good about stickerless is that you can be almost 100 sure that if youre buying a stickerless cube it will turn at least halfdecent while on stickered you may run into unfilleted cubes that require wrist rotations like the original rubiks series of course you always look closely at what youre buying but it just seems like an interesting little detail to think about,positive
thats the first time i see someone talking about colorblind speedcubers as a colorblind guy i always had a stickered cube thank you for talking about this a little bit love your vids,positive
i competed back when stickerless was illegal so i was thrilled when it was legalized just to find i enjoy stickered more i like when the stickers get worn it shows mileage on a cube which i think is cool,positive
for me whether or not the cube is stickered actually matters a lot i have always used a stickerless cube and when i got a stickered cube i noticed that i was a lot worse at look ahead i made more mistakes in f2l and took longer to look,negative
i have always used stickerless cubes from when i learned all through now one day a friend and i swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes i like my cubes fast he likes them slower his main was a stickered cube not only was i turning bad because the cube was slower then i was use to but the stickers felt so weird i just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker,negative
i prefer stickered on 3x3 because i love the look any bigger cubes the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me to many that can get damaged and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying i would probably feel differently if the stickers from speedcubeshop werent as good as they are so i would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless given the option,negative
you can get the cube here ,positive
dayum what a game breaking dupe i hope the developers patch this soon,negative
this takes “by one get one free” to a whole new level,positive

i have the spherical one my friend aradhay pronounced aradyu has a pyraminx the rediminx seems easy but its actually hard the moyu puppet cubes are so weird,negative
the pie cube looks like a round 3x2x3 so if you know how to solve a 3x2x3 you can probably solve the pie cube hope this helps,positive
it was hard enough for me to solve the normal axis cube i can’t imagine doing the 4x4,negative

maths always rocks nothing can beat mathcalculation nor magic or,positive
i tried it with an already jumbled cube no it didnt workeven it got messed up even more lol and i did absolutely as instructed ,negative

i really dont know how people can solve it and read the cube so fast with just colors,negative
dad i solved my cube in 3 seconds dad how long did it take,positive
alternate title never let a non cuber touch your expensive cubes ever again,negative
i like how this man can solve this damn cube in 13 seconds when it’s been 13 years since my last cube i still can’t even solve it,negative
i love how this channel is like beluga but a cube version editthanks for 485 likes guys can we get to 545 likes,positive
not quite sure how i stumbled across this channel but hey its pretty cool lol my skill with a cube involves trying to peel the stickers off one about 20 years ago and giving up lol,positive
im just impressed how fast you can solve an 1980s cube,positive
yeah yeah the time and the cubes are very different but the one thing everyone neglects is the price,negative
great vid keep up the great work,positive
u honestly turned quite fast on the 1980 cube lol,positive
pov he solved a cube from 1980 faster then you solve the best cube in world,positive
thanks guinness i actually made it in 2019 though had to wait for it to be ratified it would have made a great story to say i did it in lock down but the truth is i didnt,positive
buen día felicidades por esa obra monumental quedó fantástico,positive
i guess this is the best guinness record of all time mainly because of his hardwork and dedication to make this,positive
well as an obsessed cuber this has satisfied me,positive
i thought it was going to be funny but ended up being just epiclove this man,positive
the dedication that he had to not use one of those poles as a lightsaber and start breaking stuff is insane,negative
 friends channel about customization  mi canal en español  the best channel about crafts,positive
the fact that people can even do 3x3 cubes is beyond me but watching this guy did a 15x15 and in only 2 and a half hours blew my mind on another level,negative
i cant even make the 3x3 cube imagine 15x15 this man is very wise congratulations im from brazil ,positive
congratulations your effort and teaching methods are memorable good god bless you,positive
this guy is insane i can’t even solve a 3x3 in 5 hours,negative
i love solving cubes i’ve gotten real good at my 2x2 in 18 sec and i just got my megaminx but someday once i’m better at it i wanna get my hands on one of these,positive
this really made me realize the improvement in the journey of cubing i wouldnt be surprised if 20 years later i look back at my current speedcube and recall how the days were ,positive
the lighting effects look really cool,positive
i still have the 2011 one and its still a great cube i really like feeling of it want to buy more modern cube soon tho,positive
still in love with the zhanchi still using one amazing cube,positive
i was at a trampoline park and after i was done jumping i decided to play some arcade games i won 500 tickets from one game and got my first rubiks cube from there it was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction so i decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere midday with spectators around safe to say i could never get it back together i ended up buying several speed cubes and i’m able to solve all of them,negative
i love how the years go by the music gets louder,positive
imagine the future ,positive
he puts the cube in the strange shape me being annoyed that he put orange to red,negative
“this is 3 cubes” proceeds to make 4d shape in the multiverse from one single fucking 3d cube,negative
i like how he tried to do the levitation effect at the beginning up down up down,positive
we love this thanks for sharing,positive
i’m 68 years old and was challenged by my son to solve the cube he tried to show me for weeks but i couldn’t do it tried other demos and nothing i watched your video and it all clicked solved it in two days now i can do it without watching thank you for being a great instructor i’m working on a faster time now i can do it in about 6 minutes,positive
i’ve tried so many tutorials and this video was the only one that was able to teach me how to solve it you explain everything so thoroughly and in a way that’s easy to understand… you should make a tutorial for the 4x4,positive
this tutorial is amazing i was a bit confused at the end when finishing off but i eventually solved it hours later i cant believe it only took 2 days for me to solve thats really amazing for a beginner i really expected it to take weeks but it was only 2 days,positive
thank you so much for this video all of the other tutorials were a bit harder to follow but your video was followable and all of the steps were easy and organised once again thank you so much,positive
you are a fabulous teacher no ego showing off or any of the things that discourage new cubers so clear and user friendly i am an older person who has cubed for 15 years i solve many cubes cuboids odd shaped magic cubes and supercubes and these often require the basic moves you teach here so while this is very beginner it is also very useful for advanced complex cubes that cant be solved with advanced algs a pleasure i will show this video to a young neighbor whom i just gave a 3x3 and she is very excited about it i feel shed do well with your great teaching style,positive
i have been trying to solve a rubik’s cube for a year and your video has made me very confident around rubik’s cubes thank you for making this video,positive
i solved my first rubik’s cube after watching this video thank you for simplifying the process and being a great teacher ,positive
fantastic tutorial much better than the others i watched its not lengthy and simply explained time frames are much appreciated the only thing i did not enjoy in the tutorial is the last layer part bc the algorithm was not taught in the intro and i messed it up due to the lack of practice on a side note i liked when you voiced the algorithm sequence not just showed,positive
nice talent keep up the good work                shabash,positive
wow ,positive
congratulations for 50 k,positive
my real name is actually kartik im proud of my clone,positive

me proceeds to turn one side of a completely red cube brain turn it back me what’s the worse that will happen cube turns into a scrambled 40x40 brain told you so,negative
finally a rubik cube i can easily solve,positive
i love when music is synced with the rotation of the cube,positive
musiccube rotation is god level,positive
thanks bro i already learnt 15 tricks of rubix cube and this is my 16  i have seen your video 17 times to learn this after this i got a pain due to twisting of my hand thanks again,positive
me trying in window just like him 1 st time my balance goes cube rip ,negative
thanks bro i learned from u,positive
fun fact when she solved the yellow side she didnt actually just solve the whole yellow side randomly she actually got the whole first layer done,positive
and this was the backstory of two of the best cubers in the world,positive
as a cuber i loved how they entered the color areintation correctly and used actual oll algorithms in the animation,positive
ive watched that when i was a non cuber kid it literally gives nostalgic feel,positive
shes speedcubing in another level by learning cfop so fast,positive
i gotta say hats off to all the animators and editors that made this masterpiece,positive
fun fact when she solved the yellow side she didnt actually just solve the whole yellow side randomly she actually got the whole first layer done,positive
thanks so much for this video it was oddly satisfying to watch and i love the animation and animation style this must have taken a long time to make kudos,positive

it is very nice i learned it,positive
congratulations you have just solved the solved cube,positive
wow you are genius,positive
its either up or downhahaha btw nice video,positive
i recently got myself the impossible cube that you showed at the end there regular rubiks brand and it both popped and had stickers fall off right out of the box i believe they either dont give a shit because theyre still the largest or theyre incompetent,negative
i have a rubiks cube thats almost 20 years old i got into cubing recently and bought a meilong as soon as i got some disposable pennies i always assumed that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age but seeing how your brand new cube turns exactly like mine now i wish i could get my hands on a new one just to see if there is any difference,negative
my friends are going to a speed cubing comp next week so they wanted to get me into it too currently have a broken thumb and a rubiks brand cube my best time is 34556 i learned how to solve it 3 days ago and i’m currently dreaming of how fast i can get my time up to if i had a working cube and thumb,positive
i have only had a rubiks cube for the entirety of my speed cubing journey im finally going to get a good speed cube but my best time on a regular cube is 40 seconds it can be improved im sure,positive
the og rubiks cube was set up to be basically temperamental child proof like you demonstrated you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle but its also super unlikely to pop or cornertwist during normal use noncubers often consider a cube broken if its popped or cornertwisted i remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin cornertwisted it that comes at the expense of having almost no cornercutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn but then again its not meant to be their speedcube the rubiks brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though but for different reasons,negative
i have had a rubixs cube for about 6 years now and in all that time it has never popped i am not much of a speedcuber but i average at around 40 seconds on that cube and i know about 10 algorithms it has got a couple of scratches but it still works like a charm now i am going more into speedcubing and i am considering buying a magnetic speedcube,positive
love how you make videos for noncubers too i hope it will make more people into speedcubing3,positive
i forgot to say i wait about a minute or two and then my coffee gets  ,positive
me can i get some ice with that jeanelle sorry our ice machine broke,negative
“too lazy to make ice cubes” bro you pour water in a tray and leave it in a freezer that’s apl,negative
me after trying metal icewhy does my water test like metal,negative
my mother used to use plastic ice cubes back in the 90s i impressed all my friends they were colorful and cool i also was the first vegan on my block my friends would beg for our vegan food which was really just regular food with no cheese or meat haha yeah i miss those days haven’t tried the metal ones nice,positive
just a tiny minus you cant chew on the ice,negative
the one fear i have with these things is accidentally swallowing them its easy to forget theyre not really ice cubes id use a straw with these 100 of the time,negative
i remember going to a friends house and seeing these but the plastic version and i thought they were real so i was there trying to bite through their plastic ice cubes while my friend just stared in shock,negative
i used to freeze a metal spoon and use it to stir my hot drinks when i was a kid i totally recommend it if you just want to chill it and be done,positive
how to solve the rubiks cube faster ► please read this before commenting i try to reply often but i dont get step x or it doesnt work is too unspecific and i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the 4 moves 152 has the 4 moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what 4 moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step 1 2 if the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way i showed it in the video then you need to redo it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly i talk about this in the video how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the second layer step 3 at 533 i say you should already know how to do this i admit this is unclear you should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer if this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step 4 if you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 5 there should be no problems here step 6 if you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 7 finish the 4 moves dont stop at 3 every time turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved why do i need to reassemble the cube randomly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back full example solve,negative
“learn the rubix cube in 10 min” 3 hours of going back 10 seconds later edit i’d just like to announce that i have done the “impossible” and solved the cube if someone such as myself can then i’m more than hopeful whoever reads this is capable of doing the same,positive
this actually worked really well for me the first time i tried it it took me awhile but i got to the last step then messed it up but i realized it was still partially solved somehow except the yellow was the one that was solved and the white was broken up i just redid the last few steps with the cube upsidedown yellow on the bottom and white on the top and it worked thanks for this wonderful tutorial this was my first time solving a rubiks cube,positive
this is clearly an old video but lemme say ive been watching this video everyday for the last week or two and i can finally solve the cube without watching its been a long waiting bucket list thing to solve this without help and i got it thanks j perm loved the video and your content,positive
i love this tutorial its pretty easy to follow thank you,positive
thanks man even tho i never would have got this on my own it was still super satisfying to solve one for the first time ,positive
nothing hurts more than being on the last step and then messing up the algorithm,negative
took me couple hours but i did it thanks to this guide appreciate it ,positive
thanks you so much for this video solved my first cube today with your help ,positive
thank you i am now part of the small percentage of people to completely solve a rubiks cube couldnt have done it without this video,positive
this song hit different when you actually having a good day,positive
the idea of a song about having a plain old good day from a genre that usually produces music about death and the lowest points of life… it’s really something to cherish,positive
this song is so reassuring in a strange way its so comfortable to listen like a goodol friend youre happy is around,positive
nostalgia pura ,positive
this song is the how the last day of school feels like,positive
one of my fav’s from back in the day still a masterpiece nothing these days touches the rap hip hop from the 90’s i had a major crush on ice ,positive
question is why would someone want to hide their rubiks cube that desperately,negative
that’s cool i also have a shashibo but i don’t have enough to hide my cube unless i make it a hexagon,positive
this is the type of infinity cube i want to see in my local shops,positive
thats actually a really good use clever,positive
this stuff never fails to confuse the heck out of me,negative
this guy is a rubiks cube master ,positive
its not very secret its more of a storage system but still quite amazing,positive
this content is amazing keep it up,positive
which of these angry contestants got simon cowell to snap watch here,negative
we know our cube is magic but this takes things to a whole new level ,positive
as a competitive cuber i can see how he does some of his tricks but still a ton of them are just insane,negative
the real definition of talent hats off to this man master at his work,positive
this guy deserved the finals at the least man his acts increased in complexity in each stage his presentation was nice he was polite as well indulged the judges in all the acts they were all genuinely suprised i dont know why he didnt get the chance thou,positive
im speechless such a talent such a master of rubiks cube totally impressive,positive
i love this guy the artistry the presentation the judge influence and involvement this guy was meant to be a performer and he does it so well,positive
i love when simon goes speechless with those expressions,positive
first the rubiks brand then magnetic then maglev and now smart cubes the evolution of rubiks cubes are taking a change for the better and its because of people like u spreading the message far and widelets show some love for the cubing youtube community,positive
the cube it honestly is really impressive and cool the games seem so fun and its definitely worth the price cuz of how long it took to make and how fun it looks if theres a 3x3 version of this my mind will completely blown away,positive
non cubers wowyou can solve a rubiks cube cubers wowcube,positive
tingman can i just thank you for everything you have done for the cubing community with wholesome amazing child friendly videos thank you so so much,positive
tingman greetings from the inventor and founder of the company thank you for my taste you made the highest quality video review of the cube thanks a lot ilya osipov,positive
kudos to the inventor what a cool idea the future starts now and if it‘s olor and tingboy approved it must be fun,positive
you may never see this comment but if you do i just want to say thank you and all the other youtube cubers for inspiring me to become a cuber and i found my love for cubing i learned to solve 2x2 to 5x5 the rubik impossible and this very morning i got my first sub minute on my 3x3 at solve time of 56 seconds and next week i be taking on the 3x3 mirror cube and im so grateful to the cubing community who is nothing but kind and supportive i cant wait to see what the cubing community has next in store for me and its been nearly 3 months since i began my cubing hobby and i wish you jperm z3 cubing all the best and every other cubing youtuber i hope to some day be able to become a speed cuber and explore more cubes but thanks for inspiring me and bringing such amazing content to youtube all the best wishes to such kind people like you and all fellow cuber youtubers i truly found what im good at and what i love to do,positive
i think that this is certainly a cube needed now it brings to fun things together that everyone loves and im sure it is sooo amazing to have,positive
insane cube great video tingman 600k soon  any comps coming up your competition vlogs are my favorite video,positive
lori is perfect for this show in general she’s amazing with retail and products just like this plus she’s great to watch,positive
it always makes me laugh when mark gives one reason and then says for those reasons im out,positive
you know i like that lori actually does a lot of business on the show,positive
kevin i will give you 400k for 15 barbara i will give you 400k for 10 kevin that is so greedy,negative
such a simple but great idea the best inventions are the ones that make you go why didnt i think of that,positive
wow the roi for this must be insane creating a bigger sized ice cube tray and marketing it towards soups very smart,positive
never knew lori had a golden ticket that’s cool,positive
mark saying souupeeer cuubees makes me laugh every time,positive
lol just a day ago you say the rossolimo is a bad opening and the best chess engine plays it goes to show how bad you are at chess and how enormous the difference is,negative
stockfish crushes itself then analyzes its mistakes what a gigachad,negative
i personally love watching stockfish magnus leela and any other chess engines at your channel,positive
1722 stockfish 15 awarding stockfish 15 a brilliant move be like yes incredible i definitely would not have seen it,positive
levy on tcec top chess engine championship there were some engine games with stockfish leela komodo etc where they played double fischer random chess dfrc essentially the pieces are randomized for both sides the games were extremely fascinating and often mind boggling you should check them out they are in the archive for s22 on dfrc i think,positive
please keep these engine games coming levy like more from tcec engine games are always so fascinating because of how high level they are,positive
i like this this should be a new series computer chess war or something,positive
three queens engines are just so sick great content with some teaching points for us carbon based units taking space and patience are key lessons thanks,positive
magnus playing in titled tuesday and speed chess championship letss goooooooo,positive
the first thing i thought when this video began was that magnus would probably be playing in the scc again damn i’m excited,positive
this is exciting apart from tt and scc theres a new global world championship too bad the rcc just finished imagine seeing magnus play every weekend against other strong players,positive
yooooooo what always felt such a hole in the chess world with magnus not participating much in the big chesscom events just because of his other tie ups this is amazing,positive
so we will see magnus in scc and some title tuesdays now thats a great news looking forward to see more magnus vs hikaru,positive
itll be cool to see the magnus bots alongside the other top player bots on the site or even in a special areaapp,positive
magnus is a pure business man ,positive
hikaru im very excited to abandon internet chess and go for classical tournaments again,positive
its never about who bring magnus or hikaru at least for me its about free analysis and quicker and lighter website so i will always go with lichess,positive
hikaru himself is proof of why online chess is so important to grow the game lol kinda explains itself,positive
i think they are upset from magnus because he is not defending his world championship title because of which they will suffer revenue losses less people will see ding vs nepo compared to magnus vs nepo less ads less sponsorship less online viewership etc,negative
hikaru continually having magnus back and showing him great respect is why despite his flaws i am still a hikaru fan,positive
i prefer esports chess it looks cooler more comfortable for the players and they can move faster,positive
fair criticisms on both sides however “online” chess played while 6ft away from your opponent is just ridiculous,negative
the monsterous power of the bishop pair demonstrated with elegant moves and amazing game ,positive
amazing attacking game i thought once grieve lost the exchange it would be a slow conversion for white but that bishop pair was really sick i love it whenever i get a bishop fortified by a pawn behind it so deep into the position its like a thorn in the opponents play easily worth an exchange,positive
hopefully they dont ruin chessable is the only good product that playmagnus has,positive
magnus owns 85 of play magnus the bid is nok 800m so he gets nok 68m equivalant to approx usd 7 million not bad ,positive
suggestion ivan sokolov vs tiger hillarp persson 1997 koge open denmark a wild and beautiful tactical game involving queen sacrifice and an awesome mating net definitely deserves a video do check it out,positive
that really is an amazing game white material advantage blacks ruined structure but the bishop pair and a long king walk to finish a great game with promotions on both sides and a queen sac,positive
objectively the bongcloud opening must be the most horrendous of options however at the same time it is hikarus trademark bongcloud is beyond good and evil,negative
bong cloud has one variation super easy to learn and surprises the opponent has to be the top 3 openings,positive
just wanna point out something interesting 1228 the alapin variation of the sicilian defence with c3 and d4 is the exact reverse of the main line variation of the english opening with c6d5 both of them are bad for the one playing against them please listen to this man and take some of his advice to heart,negative
my man levy just had mvl on his podcast then takes a massive dump on all of mvls openings for black,negative
accepting the queens gambit still remains to be my most traumatic experience in chess i remember innocently grabbing that pawn and immediately regretting playing chess,negative
qga player here i kept running into literally the exact problems you listed in that section of the video recently i tried the benko gambit in one game to see how well it would do had a completely dominant position after like 12 moves excellent video as always keep it up,positive
i have been playing the grünfeld for sometime now and honestly against 1300 lower its not that bad if you do a little study won very good games with c5,positive
what a sunday champion vs challenger magnus vs pragnnandha its going to be a cracker ,positive
i wonder who simon is supporting it is hard to tell i wish all players the best of luck in the next round,positive

learning to avoid high interest debt while also learning how to put your money to work for you by investing is a very powerful combo especially when you learn young the earlier you start investing your money and putting it to work the more time compound interest has to work its magic on your portfolio this is how im going to achieve early retirement and its possible for everyone all you need to do is learn and start,positive

chaturanga chatur means 4 anga means a partdivision  edit chatur also means clever,positive
chess is not only a game its emotion,positive
this is brilliantly done congrats,positive
im beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity theres place of brashness boldness creativity fear light touch nimbleness anger bluffs it is a beautiful game rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics it has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one how many more things are possible in a game how far ahead can pieces support each other how deep and farseeing ideas can be and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions,positive
holy guacamole that was amazing easily one of the best documentaries ive ever seen please do more about chrss history its what the chess community needs to realize this game isnt just magnus and supercomputers finding the best moves but actual styles of play and players that for so long determined the game,positive
chess clock brief history would be good to have been included in this documentary how would one classify classical chess against rapid chess without clock nevertheless this is such a good film finally a chess film that has filled the void,positive
this is so wonderfully made hope this could become a series and will include the history of the fide openings schools of thought international tournaments ratings title etc thanks again,positive
chess is and forever will be a timeless endearing game that will forever captivate the human mind long may it reign in thousands of years to come,positive
such a fascinating game and really the only game i have ever gotten so interested in the elo system is inspiring because it gives you a goal,positive
this is amazing i love documentaries and chess and they came together on my birthday lucky me ,positive
this is by no means a history of chess just a history of chess world champions there is a lot more that is more general and more interesting than who exactly beat whom in how many games,positive
its so funny to just watch them randomly move pieces with no concept of popular chess strategies and openings lol,positive
can we all appreciate how ssundees content never fails to amaze us ,positive
never imagined ssundee playing chess,negative
what’s up ian just wanted to say i’ve been here since around the time you started your ftb modded survival series with lanceypooh you have been a big impact on my life and no matter how old i get i’ll be sticking around i love you man keep doing what you want to do and making people happy,positive
whenever he didn’t know what the pieces were called i died a little sorry i just love chess,positive
finally a chess 2 it’s taken literal centuries,positive
you made chess 2 this is brilliant,positive
unironically seems like an improvement to me,positive
someone is inevitably going to make a playable online chess 2 and i cannot wait,positive
i feel like this would legitimately be a fun variation on chess,positive
i love this new update it implements a rework for basically every card and a new middle piece a jail system which is very cool and adds incetives to protect and keep alive the monkey since he can save the king giving him a great passive buff also the fish queens that even now are fake is still a great advantage to have and i personally like more that way and the new rook with his flying abilities making a great way to protect other pieces and more gameplay variety and finally a little edit to the color of the chess board who i agree the reasoning for tho is probably harder to get a blueish board than a black and white one but is not a big issue and after mentioning all of that i will give to this update a 1410 amazing work,positive
i can’t wait to see someone try to make this playable in tabletop simulator as a 3d artist i’ll even go as far as to start modeling the pieces themselves when i have time lol,positive
i know you made this as a joke but this actually does seem like a fun variant of chess edit i forgot to mention this but i think it need bird from egypt,positive
noobs you are lucky that gothamchess exists,positive
yeah i just choose my openings based on how cool the name is,positive
what i learned from this video confuse the enemy with weird moves until they do something dumb,negative
every other chess youtube channel serious explanation of intricate theory levy 69 winrate nice,positive
i cant claim that i understand everything in this video but i now understand the importance of choosing an opening and a defense to master as a beginner in order to get a deeper understanding of how to progress in my learning this video is exactly what i and probably all beginners need knowing how to know good pedagogy,positive
i recently finished watching the queens gambit on netflix and its made me want to re enter the chess world i was first introduced to chess when i was 9 years old but unfortunately my focus the next few years was on schoolive now almost graduated college and i discovered this channel and ive binged many of the videos great work and thank you for teaching chess,positive

alireza firouzja is my compatriot he is of iranian origin but has french citizenship and plays for the french flag although firouzcha is a very good chess player but he does not give iranians any practice i learn a lot from you and your tutorials thank you very much for that,positive
i greet you from iranyour teachings are very usefulthank you so much,positive
how the hell this guy is gm and captures king has no knowledge about new fide rules where 2 illegal are ending the game,negative
that’s how you shouldn’t behave in a chess game black just plays intolerant and aggressively touches on the clock i hate that,negative
eric did so good that armageddon game is kinda screwed up white was given so much time 5 min advantage i guess he needed that to beat eric,positive
congrats fedoseev and gl,positive
you put the result in the thumbnail of another video so ruins the entertainment completely thanks,negative
that’s sad,negative
best group of hosts ever makes it a delight every time and howell is outstanding,positive
i really like hans zimmers music and i loved ivankas super advice about paying attention to negative thought and practicing meditation jovanka is doing a good job and apparently she is an interesting person to say the least,positive
what chemistry among these commentators what learning and fun for us lowerrated amateurs congrats david on your olympiad medal way to show the flag of england hope you can still do commentary now and then if you join the chess tour and if you join may your skills take you to 2800 god bless,positive
congratulations again to david howell ,positive
david deserves a gold metal for his commentary as well,positive
anish giri does love studying chess theory so the prospect that he might still be in opening preparation in game 2 14412 does not surprise me that much,positive
i followed the olympiad and was floored by davids performance there were over 180 teams each with around 5 players so there must have been 800900 if not more players in the open division not one of them played more successfully than david howell moreover his efforts went a long way towards giving england a top 15 finish congratulations david howell i was very happy for you,positive
would love to see judit polgar david howell commenting that would be great,positive
btw i also saw jovanka on camera once while she was playing in the olympiad it was good to see her compete for her country england as well,positive
lets go pragg,positive
1837 the amount of times eric has made this joke and explained that he didnt actually say it just makes it all the more funny haha,positive
eric love your stalemate attempt hope your opponent could see the fun of it lol,positive
thank you for another enjoyable recap you seem moderately exhausted and mildly disheartened but the fact of the matter is you kept it close against an experienced 2600 gm that bodes well for the future if you decide to make a harder push for gm at some point good luck in your remaining rounds,positive
i got a stalemate trap over the board once it was against a 1700 rated player and he was living on a 30 increment it was a little more elaborate than your one i had to sacrifice the queen but he had no way to stop it and i got so excited i lost the ability to speak for the next 30 min and i was just thinking about you all the time so thank you for that 12 point eric,positive
prior to the 652 mark of your video i was amazed you two were both still blitzing out your moves then the reveal,positive
i love your vicious traps and lines i feel like you play so different from most players,positive
magnus just wants to have fun he could have won pragg so humble,positive
the 0 earned by hans really speak for themselves honestly this was one of the more fun chess tournaments than usual unbelievable blunders backfiring trashtalk internet crash computer crash and what not,negative
im sure that your timestamps must have helped millions,positive
magnus is becoming a content creator at this point doing goofy stuff keeping us entertained,positive
magnus pragg truly ending the crypto cup by giving the viewers an amazing show to watch with twists and turns every single move,positive
found it timestamp to magnus game 1429,positive
this is like a cow is on a highway  levy you and your humor are the things for which we patiently wait 24 hours until your new video upload ,positive
welcome everyone the beginners course is out now on my website,positive
believe it or not i’m getting a bit emotional watching this i was fascinated by chess as a kid but i was useless at it and got discouraged my dad tried to teach me but that mostly involved a lot of yelling swearing and tears this is the first time i’ve seen someone explain the game with such clarity enthusiasm patience and obvious love for the game at 32 hopefully this is the beginning of a new chess journey for me thankyou so much,positive
finally a video that has explained the concept of chess properly for beginners i have tried to learn for years and could not find anyone who had the ability to explain this to me thank you so much gothamchess ,positive
i havent played for yearsneeded a refresher thank you levi for a very informative and entertaining instructional video you are a natural and easygoing teacher entertainer hello from australia,positive
you have an awesome way of keeping a total newbie engaged and not feeling totally lost thank you looking forward to getting started,positive
very helpful i learned how the pieces moved decades ago as a kid but i never learned concepts like piece vision protecting pieces tactics vs strategies etc i taught myself a bit of these through playing but i have many holes in my understanding,positive
i have huge anxiety starting to play with other people started off marking huge mistakes but im making fewer mistakes and learning what to do instead of what i did start off really improved,positive
i’ve always loved chess even since i was a kid but i always found it too hard to remember the moves and rules when i was younger but being older now i’ve rediscovered how much i love it and this video really helped me get back into the swing of things and was also really informative i’ve subscribed and i’ll be checking out your other videos to help me along the way thank you,positive
i used to play chess with my uncles when i was a kid recently got back into it with my little brother and this video has been very helpful in refreshing my memory,positive
that boi 7 snapped on this bih he definitely done stepped it up a level,positive
stumbled on to this video by mistake never heard of this guy but i’m liking the flow  much success to you my guy ,positive
i’m playing this shit 1000 times already this boy is str8 smoke … ,negative
trap n yella punching the air on that drizzy bar this song snappin,positive
this mf song is gonna stay on repeat long live osama ,positive
much  7 you killed it big homie the laugh at the end gets me every time i cant help but laugh too ,positive
hell yeah coming with that heat ,positive
the similarity between lichess and sahil is they stand out between other platforms and also have less subscriber and low net worth perfectly made for each other,positive
love the commentary from leko great to have lawrence with him they make a great pair would love to see leko on the main stream,positive
wow peter really had tears for pragg after the heartbreak of a game for him 45500 amazing how chess players can feel each others pain and everyone does like pragg,positive
great to see lawrence back and he seems new and improved well maybe not new but improved,positive
peter leko is a very sweet guy in the way he speaks ,positive
i just dont think magnus takes chess very seriously anymore and thats his right were still thrilled to have him distracted still very entertaining and insightful still a great contributor to the chess world,positive
peter leko  45458 pragyanantha good effort man ,positive
magzy unstoppable,positive
would it be possible to make sure that the players board eval bar is never removed from the screen theres a lot of times where were showing the analysis board and the 4 faces of the playerscommentators and thats terrible for me because i cant see whats happening in the real game what the current eval is and do my own thoughts plus theres really no need to see all 4 faces and not see the board,negative
honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 12 btc from day tradng with wtrade inspects insights and charts they been one step ahead of other analysis,negative
thats why magnus really wanted to face a new generation player in the wcc since he knew they had more chances than the players of his generation its just like other tournaments even if magnus loses some games he still won the tournament looking forward to praggnanandha an amazing performance for him,positive
magnus carlsen is the goat congrats to praggim sure he will be the new world champion,positive
so happy for pragg  i was thinking push your pawns pragg at the end game please push your pawns and when he finally started doing that he had much better winning chances well done,positive
pragg continuing to be the comeback king amazing play he made this tournament extremely exciting was just glued to all his games and magnus also played really well at the start but i lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely he couldnt even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested the least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so its not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him rlly left a bitter taste but im soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring,positive
firouzja and pragganandhaa are both playing very well at this age the future is in the hands of these two young men but i cant say which one,positive
pragg i was lucky today to win the 4th game magnus i did not have good sleep yesterday lol,positive
pragg what a champ so young yet so talented the next anand for sure,positive
aronian has such a great attitude towards the game of chess such a gentleman,positive
levon aronian is by far my favourite player excellent att chess of course but a really nice and likeable person too,positive
i wish you guys would cover more than just one game per round switch around and explore several games,positive
it looked like aronian was just exhausted in game 4 and wanted to be done with it else those last moves with so much time dont make much sense for a player of his quality,negative
chess needs more funding seriously the best of the minds are fighting it out there should be more prize money for each of them,positive
pragg,positive
pragg is amazing playereven aronian smile when he lost to pragg and magnus also smile when he lost that final game to praggit is show that you are great player if opponent smile when they lost to you,positive
leko is just the best asset of chess24 d what a machine,positive
pragg the mountain goat the world is awakening to tamils mental prowness equal to the best and 2nd to none let the chess speak for itself you aint seen nothing yet,positive
winning a high level tournament while chilling and enjoying a comedy podcast magnus seems to have found the right combination of workchill,positive
magnus the  wins another event the man just can’t stop winning one event after another,positive
great event,positive
you can’t rlly blame him he missed a mate in 4 with 10 seconds left,negative
magnus is the biggest heart of chess player he delibrately lost himself at the final he won the tournament and won everything actually the true winner is someone who gives the winning to those who more needed magnus did and always does taking knight e6 are you kidding,positive
bring wesley back and give a shot to raunak better than pragg the next vishy,positive
and magnus introduced the new laughing gambitbut tbh magnus such a beast even he blunders somewhere hell find all good moves after and manages to holdprag too well played n not pushed too muchgg,positive
agad humour is why we love this channel the tongue in cheek comment in timestamps the knight making fancy moves to pick up the pawn the inside joke on the b4 square man it makes my day ,positive
pragg and carlsen are making the best games in the whole tournament,positive
im glad the timestamps have returned i typically jump to the first timestamp given it is typically where the game starts so i still heard what you said antonio i see you p,positive
i love antonios philosophy moments like this one about the time stemp people who will never know what he has said,positive
woah so many double takes throughout this match every time i glanced away magnus slipped out of another hairy situation magnus is a magician  ,positive
the main reason i like alex is because she is genuinely interested in people and pays attention to them when they speak tell stories etc very rare nowadays imo,positive
trash talker snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,negative
what a turnaround plus this was a particularly good video because she sort of interviewed him about his lifes experience with chess so its a trash talk gamewith an interview alex is juggling three things during this video liked the written commentary tips as well,positive
man he messed that one up so so bad had a free rook and totally threw his advantage right in the eternal bowels of fire hell,negative
love how you tell him he is not hitting the clock right could waste your time while he is making a move and he won’t change so you start hitting the clock twice two too funny,negative
i was born as an orphan lost me right at the start ,negative
after that moment when he started talking shit into the camera he fell apart lol classic overconfidence right there,negative
amazing comeback i really tought that taking the rook still will give him a win but in the end that didnt help and wow really nice to see that you didnt collapse to time pressure thats for sure inspiring great gaming from both d,positive
great game alexandra love the irl chess streams and tournaments keep up the good work,positive
that fake training tip has given me an epiphany about everything i do in life thank you levy,positive
local sight is a common mistake at least for me at fast time controls you focus your attention on a specific area of the board and just forget that far beyond a long range piece is defending a square you judge unprotected,negative
dude the fake training tip really does apply to everything i’ve been practicing life drawing every day but just mindlessly putting marks on paper without internalizing new concepts no wonder why i haven’t improved in quite a while thanks for opening my eyes gotham,negative
i’ve started late in life at 58 and i’ve been paying for a year now i decided to get better after i got so angry during lock down playing with my husband that i felt sooo silly then watching your videos over and over made a big difference and in the last couple of months i’ve had some pretty amazing breakthrough so thank you,positive
this was more than a chess lesson this was a life lesson thank you levy,positive
this video is exactly what the doctor ordered for me i am guilty of all of these im overly fake trained on puzzles with an overconfidence and overinflated 20002100 puzzle rating but in online games im getting my ass handed to me by 1200 players because of all these mistakes time to do a major reset i made a post it cheat sheet on these 7 mistakes and will keep it in front of me as i play future online games time to get back to completing all the opening courses i have on chessable thanks levi,negative
she really said “good thing my sister is not here”  the dad said “she’ll lose too”  what a savage,negative
i lost in four moves to my 5 year old son once i felt very humbled and a bit foolish he was beaming with triumph at having defeated his dad at chess,positive
dear andrea i was thoroughly impressed by your welcoming warm attitude and your gracious and warm attitude when you lost i think that the way you played and engaged young kai will stay with him for the rest of his life you may not be at this time the number one chess player in the world but i think youre doing something far more important youre winning the hearts of these children and that is a gift that will stay with them for life thank you for sharing,positive
i love how they just had fun and kept smiling i do wonder how well they would have done if not multitasking,positive
what a wonderful young lady you are to work with children and a big congratulations to the young man he was so happy while playing,positive
i still remember the last chess tournament i played in i competed against 9 opponents at the same time while blindfolded lost every game gotta have goals,negative
this is just a simple respectful game of chess and i love it that kid is great i support him,positive
that was a perfect show of great sportsmanship hats off to both the players,positive
this is just a simple respectful game of chess and i love it that kid is great i support him,positive
damn bro prag is goddamn great at endgame  he doesnt do a single mistake even if he is low on time magnus narrowly escaped  but anyway 2 great days for him,positive
so nice that at the end levon and jan walked together to talk to svene great sportsmanship something hans should learn from,positive
i said it a million times and i will always do david howel is the most underrated chess player in the whole world the sharpness of this guy and the speed he spots the perfect moves is not something you can ignore also i watch this show because of david i can always check the matches results anywhere but i always come here just to watch david and simon my favorite 2 chess players,positive
daved jovanka kaja simon you are the best thank you you made me love chess ,positive
a huge congrats david well done cheers kev,positive
i am so happy for david achievement million congratulations ,positive
congrats david what a legend,positive
great cast as always,positive
i had the honor of speaking personally with rené letelier and he was a true gentleman the great thing about him is that he became an international master without even being a professional chess player he worked in a bank and in his free time or vacations he played tournaments regarding this game he mentioned that he just enjoyed every move that fischer made on the board letelier played 3 times against fischer being defeated 2 times and beating bobby 1 time sorry my english its not my first language,positive
we love jerrys videos his analysis is excellent jerry we hope you will review some of the games at this years candidates tournament,positive
i really liked the way the game was described each move was analyzed with possible options giving the viewer opportunity to see how fischer developed his strategy some commentators are too fast too slick this was much better,positive
jerry your videos are some of the most instructive on the internet my top 3 favorite youtubers are you gotham and daniel naroditsky gotham teaches you how to understand broad overarching concepts like a master daniel teaches you how to understand the fine details like a master and you teach us how to realize what masterlevel thinking even looks like seriously i studied tactics and positional chess for years and couldnt advance past 1200 but your beginner to gm series totally revolutionized the way i looked at the board i gained more in the 2 years since i watched those videos than i did in my previous 5 years of serious chess study,positive
what a beautiful game i’ve never seen this before one of the many reasons bobby fischer may have been the greatest player ever,positive
i think im speaking in name of every one here when i say we need more videos jerry we love your videos,positive
hey jerry been watching you for more than 14 years now and i pretty much owe you my accent thanks for the chess analysis and english that you have taught me during this huge period of time and i really would like to see your face while listening to you please keep it in your mind you are excellent take care ,positive
im certainly not a good chess player i think your narration was perfect it gave me insights as to what the great players are thinking its the best chess video ive seen thanx,positive
quality over quantity watching your powerful well thought analysis always shows me youre on another level thanks for your effort,positive
i was just thinking yesterday “man it’s been a while since jerry uploaded” always a joy to see you uploading especially the analysis vids,positive
massive respect to jeffrey for sportsmanship,positive
this playoff series and 2game match format is absolutely insane 1010 ,positive
ggs the semi matchups are so good,positive
smells like wesley vs ian to me ,positive
oh the broadcast of the faces are so delayed you don’t see hikaru reacting to his own blunder until the guy responds to the move in real time hikaru had the same reaction as danya as soon as he played the move haha i hate when they happens right as you let go of the piece you see why it’s bad,negative
getting gooood,positive
magnus power is unbelievable he even took over agadmators mind for a second and made him bongcloud,positive
when agadmator played king e2 by mistake that was the brilliancy that we hoped to see,positive
the way alirezas bishop and rook coordinated to keep harassing carlsens queen was magical,positive
not sure which i like more watching magnus win or watching him lose either way its great to watch,positive
magnus has become so good hes just trying random things  god level,positive
since i started watching your channel the phrase threatens nasty discoveries has been lodged so deep in my mind i will be dreaming it constantly till i die,negative
the coordination of white’s pieces in this game was beautiful,positive
and its now as of move seven that we have a completely new gamewho else likes this line from agad ,positive
danny is  great games,positive
this is one of the best chess games i have ever watched the other one was here too in the same park fun friendly relaxed and brilliant thanks anna you are a real champion,positive
thats my cousin always had a kind heart and always loved chess while we were goofing around as kids i would watch that boy read chess books and wash grown men im so proud of you man,positive
she said danny plays an aggressive style but actually if you look he is quite positional loves the two bishops and throws in an h4 to throw off his opponent he tries to make make very tiny advantages that eventually point at your king i simply love his playing style,positive
im so impressed by danny’s ability to delay castles in both games he seems very aware of the positional advantages that he can take by delaying,positive
anna love the videos 2 suggestions 1 itd be awesome if you could show the clock somehow maybe a digital clock that can be synchronized to the video 2 if you or opponent resign a 30 second explanation of why it was resigns at the end would be awesome in this case i saw your b on a5 was hanging and whites rook defending their e2 bishop but its not always super easy for us to figure out,positive
anna took two losses in a row and was laughing and having fun with a strong player its amazing to watch two pros go neck and neck at each other like this thank you so much,positive
other than an amazing player danny seems really modest and kind i wish i was living anywhere near these kinds of parks i love how its nice weather people casually walking by and stop to spectate the game it kind of restores my faith in this world,positive
gotta love chess…how does a random dude in the park casually crush a fm with a lifetime of training and world famous gm parents she earns my respect for posting this,positive
need a danny youtube his play style would be really fun to watch consistently,positive
also interesting for curious people pragg has been called as grunfeld slayer by gm howell – as he has won 100 of his games as white against it,positive
pragg is becoming my favorite chess player still love chuckys games but pragg is putting in that work and making magic happen on the board,positive
prag is a monster i hope he will become one day wc i love this guy he is a nice person and so humble indians peoples can be proud of him,positive
pragg in yesterdays interview i just want to play a better chess tommorow and he did play it,positive
pragg vs magnus is getting the hype as they are the only players unbeaten on all rounds,positive
its actually game 1 of the fischer larsen match of 1971 ive been searching for that incredible game thanks for the heads up on it i remember back in the day on my chessmaster library yasser seirawan described it beautifully when he said the bishop pair had two jobs one to guard the king and two to shepherd the a pawn home a masterclass,positive
and just a few minutes before the child has defeated levon in the final match also it was as awesome as this one or better than this one,positive
watching eric destroy his opponents while dancing is one of the best things i have ever seen in chess you will not play alone in the final the boys are with you lets goooooo,positive
eric hansen on god mode go eric one of my favorite streamers,positive
eric also beat hikaru at drunken lawn wrestling,positive
great job,positive
watch till the end for the twist ,positive
the computer couldnt comprehend his selfsacrificing move yeah because kings cant move into check,negative
inventor i feel bad so we could either a ill pay for therapy and some extra money to help him recover or b we can organize an elaborate death game that will require a whole bunch of set pieces actors and effects to traumatize him a different way wife i like b lets do b,negative
this is the 2nd part of a japanese anthology film first one is a horror episode 3rd one is a comedy and the last one i think is a romance scifi overall a great film and it introduced me to the awesomeness of nonhollywood content since i watched it years ago this recap makes me want to rewatch the film again thanks,positive
i really loved the ending accepting ones mistakes without hesitations is a true winner of all winners ,positive
i really was expecting a really messed up ending where the wife actually never loved him or something like that didnt expect it to be a wholesome ending great stuff ,negative
1022 lmao the computer couldnt understand the kings sacrifice move that gm vidit gujrathi made against hikaru and selfdestruct,negative
040 grandmaster vs computer super blue first player to lose a computer well thats just movie version of happened in 1997 where grandmaster gary kasparov lost to deep blue,negative
this was absolutely priceless and brilliant this really made my day thank you great narration too thanks for making me laugh in the car as a bishop with a rook key ring hahahaha i love you japan,positive
great production great coverage and a show that is so levelled that you can watch it while you are busy doing other things thanks chess 24,positive
liem is the opposite of niemann polite smiley and composed,negative
hans also played well he could have gone for a draw think he wanted to go for a win and lost best wishes to him too,positive
35000 awkwardthe interview is happening with the sponsor just when the carlsenaronian game has the champion sac a queen lol hard to cut away from the sponsor when that happens murphys law in action,negative
praggananda is great,positive
omgit just popped into my head that anish giri looks like michael jackson,positive
great,positive
hope hans is fine hes a good player its always fun to watch his games a bit of trash talk never harmed nobody,positive
at this point hans niemanns chess has stopped speaking now its screaming in pain,negative
we keep saying its the magnus effect not talking about basketballs and dams here but would be interesting to test this in an esport i follow age of empires 2 one player theviper was so dominant for so long that a streamer t90official came up with the idea of an event he called hidden cup where everyones identities were hidden and only revealed at the end each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who was a really interesting concept as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who theyve repeated the format 4 times now which says something about how loved it is but with chess being an online thing now this kind of event is very possible and i think would be fascinating would magnus still win theviper did so proved that theory wrong at least for him,positive
if he was winning nobody would be talking very true wordshopefully hans will comeback,positive
game 4 was insane all praggu needed was a draw and he pulls out an untested gambit then sacrifices a second pawn the chess world is changing doesn’t he know he’s supposed to play the berlin and force a draw,negative
i still can’t believe he gets the privilege of playing with the best chess player in the world magnus sure is a lucky man,positive
magnuss reactions are hilarious he looks genuinely shocked by some of the moves ludwig plays,positive
i love how excited magnus gets when ludwig plays the move he wanted,positive
crazy that lud is wellknown enough in the chess community that he can collab with the greatest in the world,positive
magnus’ reaction when ludwig does a bad move or blunder is comedy we need more magnus and ludwig collars edit i hate autocorrect,negative
magnus must be so happy to play with the best chess player in the world happy for him,positive
candidates participants i have to train the hardest i ever have to be able to play against magnus for his title magnus,negative
online chess is far inferior to normal chess i can’t flip the board in anger,negative
black moves pawn to a6 me good move eric ok this is the first big blunder,negative
chess does not improve focus it worsens it everytime i try to do something i want to play chess so i cant focus on the task at hand,negative
oh so cool gg eric i was hoping to at least make you think a bit harder but oh well haha,positive
considering how lopsided this game was materialwise black held on for an amazing amount of time,positive
not bad,positive
chess is so easy to learn yet so hard to master,negative
stalemate is a thing that rarely happens me in every game i play oh boy how wrong you are,negative
the queens gambit was the first thing that came to my mind when i saw the title of the video but lets be honest i have to watch the video and play chest many times in order to learn but this was pretty helpful thank you,positive
my friend is in the nationals of chess championships so he taught me chess but still this helped me a lot thanks,positive
it makes me so happy to see chess getting popular,positive
nice inspiring chess video for the learners thanks bright side,positive
and he died at 64 one year for every square on the board poetic,negative
spasky was arguably even more impressive by being a grandmaster of kindness,positive
i remember watching an interview with fischer and he mentioned how during matches even the wrong lighting would throw him off definitely seems like he might have had sensory issues that weren’t well understood at the time,negative
my grandfather actually played with bobby regularly in 1956 at the west orange chess club in new jersey they played on the same team in interstate tournaments i found some of my grandpa’s old letters and it’s pretty cool he won multiple chess championships some amateur and some professional in the late 40s and early 50s he also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines he was born in 1909 and while i like to think he taught bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year it’s likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa my grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially chess tournaments didn’t pay well back then though he probably played teenage bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future if a 13 year old made a multitime champion quit the game entirely he must have been truly special my grandpa could card count so i don’t think he had a problem switching to bridge and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career i never got to meet him because he died before i was born i’m only 23 i would’ve loved to ask him about bobby maybe my mom knows a bit more all i have are letters and a few chess trophies it’s very hard to collect information from the early 50s,positive
the light sensitivity and erratic behavior are symptoms of a person on the spectrum it is not uncommon for people like this to prefer lamps to ceiling lights as the glare is annoying to them lashing out comes from difficulty communicating feeling different and knowing you are different it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess while playing he probably felt safe knowing the rules knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didnt understand or care about,negative
my dad tried to teach me chess i was only 10 he was 52 i picked up the moves of the pieces easily halfway through our first game he said “do you have a strategy or are you just making moves at random” i said “making moves at random” he boxed up the pieces and that was that i later turned out to be a terrific poker player ,positive
incredibly done ,positive
apart from the blindfold this is the nicest levy has ever been,positive
first of all as someone that has played chess for close to 20 years on and off i am impressed with the results that michelle made in a short time chess is a game that you have to play for months at the very least to become good at it takes time to recognize patterns and then feel comfortable enough playing against someone else that has also been playing for a while you did great michelle,positive
thank you so much for reaching out early in 2021 i am so thrilled we got to start this journey and everything it became congratulations on a spectacular episode cheers to us all hating chess together,positive
im officially addicted to rewatching this shit over and over i think michelle really put her finger on the main problem with chess because its so much tied to our perception of intelligence not being good enough makes you feel dumb and embarrassed rather than just treating it as another skill to learn once you get over this barrier in your head it becomes fun,negative
anna and her its castlemania had me at the edge of my seat cheering lovely to have someone so supportive and excited for you in your corner,positive
fun fact magnus carlsen has won ten games at the same time while blindfolded before however this pales in comparison to the world record 48 games played blindfolded at the same time held by grandmaster timur gareyev,positive
forgot to mention british people are extremely good at chess cuz their queen is immortal,positive
chess is one of those games where you can prove you’re smarter in every way just by winning,positive
as someone who used to really be into chess i can indeed validate that everything said in this video is true,positive
thanks james really informative for an older beginner like me im 59 i always fail because the young players are so fast at assessing positions and adapting now i can have a system hopefully ill feel less disoriented ,positive
would love to see you playing a game live preferably a rapid game at 1520mins time control and how you yourself use these aspects to analyse evaluate a positions as the game goes on i think that would be great viewing,positive
dear friend id like to congratulate you on starting this kind of educational videos ive watched hundreds of your analysis theyre brilliant im sorry dont know your name itd be great if you please introduce yourself briefly in the next video thanks again and wishing you all the best,positive
this is the type of stuff that will make you grow because a lot of people are casual non club players but love chess and are always willing to learn,positive
material squares pawns initiative development space minor piece king safety got it excellent toolkit how could you define activity is activity an umbrella concept for initiative space development minor pieces very nice new format digging up old wisdom in chess books thanks a lot,positive
im getting better but analyzing whos better but converting that advantage of pieces or space into a win is still a big challenge,positive
enjoying the new direction my tattoo didn’t need any more new prodigies ,positive
good stuff,positive
good job,positive
thank you sir for your wonderful explanation,positive
1 of the best by alekhine sir a match where alekhine with black exchanged queens in style sac of 2 rooks for rebirth of his queen 01 outstanding game,positive

i’d love to get the 14 pro it’d be a ni e upgrade from my 11 but it’s sooo expensive,positive
i havent had a new iphone for a few years im very hyped to see what has changed,positive
moving over to ios from android in september looking at picking up the iphone 14 pro max if i can get a great deal at a later date im looking at adding airpods pro 1 or 2 was going to stick with android but due to the samsung s22 ultra being shipped with the exynos chip and throttling back performance in the uk its led me to switching to an iphone,positive
planning on upgrading from a xr but having no usbc leaves a sour taste on my mouth,negative
im really looking forward to getting the smaller 61 inch iphone 14 pro graphite 512gb,positive
apple watch pro gonna my first apple watch wanted apple for a long time to take the watch to the extreme and finally its happening,positive
dont ask me how i posted this 3 hours before the official apple announcement i am not a wizard i do not own a time machine please disregard all rumors saying i own a time machine,negative
wow 2 weeks time is flying by fast great work as always greg hope to finally upgrade still wish for a pink color in the pros lol,positive
love the content greg keep it up,positive
have updated every year but not this year……keeping the mini because it’s the perfect size easy inout of pocket one handed for nearly every feature,positive
finally the front facing camera moving to the horizontal position  now if only they would carry this over to the pro models that’s when i would buy one as i do zoom and teams calls and the current ipad setup is totally frustrating,negative
this is crazy finally a new event oh yeah i hope for the ipad 10th gen and of course iphone 14 i need to make a video about it on my channel too,positive
i used to own a time machine well actually a time capsule but the drive in it failed i would love to see apple bring back a modern version of that device the pro watch is attractive i’m still rocking a 6 and forget about any new iphone until they have usbcthunderbolt 4,positive
will wait one more year for the universal connectivity of usbc and the better battery life and speed of the 3nm processor,positive
im buying iphone 14 pro max and apple watch 8 plus newest airpods pro been saving ages cheers dude wont the pro max come with 16 out of the box though ,positive
thanks for the informative video i have an iphone 13 pro and probably gonna stick with it for maybe 34 years ,positive
lets go its satellite time baby ,positive
my day instantly gets better whenever sam uploads i cant wsit for this event i hope we get the satellite connectivity feature the new prices are terrifying ,positive
it seems way more likely to me that the invite is actually referring to astrophotography the iphone has improved a lot in the last few years at lowlight photography especially if youre using a tripod plus if theres going to be a 48mp camera sensor thatll be amazingly helpful for nighttime shots im about as confident about that as sam is about it being satellite connectivity ,positive
ill be upgrading to the iphone 14 pro max after using an 8 plus for five years so i imagine ill really feel that upgrade stoked,positive
i seriously hope ian and luke is on the genius bar podcast this week,positive
astrophotography can it finally take pictures of the moon like my dslr i love your channel nd podcast and cant wait for the 14 pro max,positive
i’m honestly waiting for the new ipad pro’s to drop might make the m1 pros available for cheaper refurbished or otherwise heck it may make the 2018 ones even cheaper,positive
seeing how things are lately coming out with apple ive been very excited to see what comes out great coverage and updates as always sam lol 409 luke just so casual in the background ,positive
i so hope they drop the airpods pro 2 at this event that’s all i’m interested in at the minute,positive
you don’t know how happy i am to see you back john keep doing what you do,positive
dont scare us like that jon im glad youre back in front of the camera,positive
order of event prediction 1 intro what apple has achieved so far this year eco stuff privacy etc 2 apple tv showsmovies and more apple music songs announcement 3 iphone 14s 4 iphone 14 pros 5 ipad 10th gen 6 apple watch series 8 7 apple watch pro 8 software release with exact date for ios and a rough date for ipados and macos,positive
heres my prediction for the products being launched 0 some new subscription service probably related to apple tv 1 airpods pro 2 2 apple watch regular se then pro probably with some new fitness related service as well 3 iphone 14 series regular then pros,positive
i missed fpt welcome back jon ,positive
heres my current prediction for this event intro what apple had achieved this year compared to other years new apple tv plus subscription service updated ipad airpod pros 2 apple watch regular se then pro probably with a new fitness service iphone 14 series regular then pros,positive
my prediction for that event will be they will start off with the the new software and the new chip then move on to the apple watches and after they last thing will be all about the iphone and of course the iphone 14 pro and pro max with all the new functions well that’s my predictions hope to with that iphone but still best of luck to every one ,positive
good to see you back john my prediction 1 new subscription service 2 new software update ios then ipados 3 airpods pros 2 4 apple watch 8 then ruggedpro edition 5 iphone 14 regular then pros,positive
whos excited for september 7th,positive
when it comes to apple the key to the hints they give is not to overthink it and i’m pretty sure this is related to the newer bigger camera that’s gonna be on the phones that will take beautiful pictures of the night sky if there’s one thing i’ve learned about apple in the past 10 years is that they aren’t that deep,positive
it’s going to be sooo awesome this year and i can’t wait for all the fun we’re gonna have in the livestream  i really hope the iphone 14 pro’s coming purple it’s my first time not wanting to buy the space gray ,positive
it’s be great if they gave us the feature to watch a video in one screen while watching on a live show to start in another screen top and bottom also the ability to add covers to the multi app clusters to make the screen look cleaner the ability to to swipe conversations to the side like picture in picture while doin other things instead of having to go back and forth between apps,positive
im excited to see what apple announces at the event im really hoping for a camera with more than 12 megapixels i think it would be a game changer for sure especially for photographers like me all in all im excited for the event,positive
i am very excited i do believe it is focused on iphone and apple watch along with maybe some new airpod pro models the ipad release along with a new mac pro computer will come in october it will be strange getting ios watchos and tvos updates but no ipad out west on the same day it is called confusion apple needs to work on consistency and not just jumping around like they decided to do if that is what will happen i’d like apple because of their consistency and being able to keep things in the same time frame hopefully i was 16 and watchos along with tvos will be released on monday september 12 which is a scheduled day off for me from work i do not like getting updates while i am at work because it will take time to install them i did watch youtube video from a different channel and i replied to the comments about compatibility for next year and he thought that iphone 8 would not be compatible with ios 17 in 2023 do you think this is true if so should my parents who have iphone 8 models should upgrade this year or wait until before i was 17 comes out out i did tell them about the iphone se thirdgeneration because neither one seems interested in upgrading to my iphone 12 or getting one with face id themselves,positive
i usually switch back and forth yearly between apple and android as i like both fanboy of neither but apple is hitting a peak and really not innovating much anymore i’m just going to switch from the 13 pro max to the s22 ultra as i said i love both but i’m not seeing any reasons to upgrade with apple this year if the 15 is a game changer it will be right up my yearly cycle routine switch between both ,positive
thank you so much brandoni love your entertaining and informative videosi really appreciate your efforts and dedicationyou are so awesome and amazingi can’t wait for the iphone 14s and ios 16keep up your great efforts brandon,positive
here’s an  what if apple made an iphone mini 2 starting around 1099with three cameras no notch but have it the size of the current 13 mini small but super powerful and i know a bunch of people would buy it cmon mini gang where yall at,positive
the thing i am most interested in is seeing how apple will sell the 14 with a straight face,positive
airpods without stems would loose their character,negative
i truly appreciate your videos because of you i’ve kept my xsmax and my apple watch 5 i don’t see the need to upgrade until next year if apple go to the usbc,positive
good news with keeping the stem i always wondered how they could pull a stem removal off without killing usability i mean how the hell should you press a button when this thing is turning 180° and then buttons are on the inside,negative
iphone 14 will be the most amazing incredible outrageous thing anyone has seen anywhere in all of time and even beyond time it will run ios 15 come in many colors take great photos and videos will be able to charge on a little black plate on a table extreme perfect infinite edit whenever and always multitask exquisitely play very special music and movies and like the last 3 generations will be enable you to multi task at lightning speed but perhaps a little faster but you will not be able to notice since the last one was so fast it will be pure magic ,positive
i am ready for september 7 hopefully ios 16 and watchos now will come out on monday the 12th that would be a good release date i find it funny that ipados will be delayed a month that is very strange it seems like apple would just wait until stage manager got fixed and release it with a subsequent update like ipados 161 or 1601,positive
on the beta ios 16 there is a battery indicator feature in battery settings it is automatically set so default to only show in low power mode instead of the bar decreasing it will always show you your battery ,positive
mich interessiert diese mal vor allem das technische innere der iphones beim macbook air m2 hat apple beim kleinsten speicher lediglich einen einzelnen baustein verbaut und die geräte sind deshalb angeblich langsam falls diese technik auch bei den iphones verbaut wird bin ich schon gespannt was drinnen ist und zum iphone mini ich könnte mir vorstellen dass dieses gerät in naher zukunft als iphone se 42024 oder se 52026 zurückkommt ,positive
you know what is sad when you cant trust to even update your phone cause how bad the corruption is,negative
this presents a problem notice this mysterious hacker would try to target everyday people instead of the powers that be,negative
these issues are not growing pains its risky business,negative
that’s why we all know if you update your phone when the new phones are about to come out it kills your battery messes with your old one so you were forced to buy a new one,negative
i hate how these companies’ need to innovate “for” us always creates problems and bloated operating systems—for us microsoft is worse,negative
my iphone auto updated last night and when i looked at my notifications this morning i had a notification telling me there has been an apple data leak and they recommend changing all my current passwords now this smh ,negative
j’ai hâte de voir à quoi vont ressembler les iphone 14 surtout les modèles pro ,positive
c’est le mercredi 7 septembre pas mardi ,positive
nice vidéo mais le son reste quand même suis content de tes infos merci ,positive
c’était super cool chère ami  à très bientôt pour ta prochaine vidéo ciao ,positive
meilleur photo zoom meilleur photo de nuit pour voir les étoiles,positive
fort ,positive
which apple product are you most excited about in september this is the best iphone accessory in 2022  links to the best iphone accessory deals on amazon  airpods pro on sale  airpods 3 sale ,positive
i know i’m in the minority but i love my 13 mini will be keeping that until it can’t go anymore or some huge leap in tech comes also got a titanium apple watch 7 at launch and will be keeping that until we get a huge leap in battery tech,positive
i have an iphone 11 pro that im completely happy with im still impressed by the cameras on it beautiful pictures and video is there any compelling reason for me to upgrade to the 14 otherwise ill wait until the 15 with usbc,positive
ill upgrade when they finally put usbc on next years iphone,positive
whoevers reading this i pray that whatever youre going through gets better and whatever youre struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day amen,positive
apple is making a big mistake by giving the apple watch pro all the nice features we’ve been waiting for a redesign for the apple watch for awhile but apple will just have to deal with the consequences and watch as all this pro watches sit on shelves and collect dust just like the original homepod,negative
thanks for all the updates and i’m looking forward to the event,positive
get ready guys ,positive
now thats a good newssuper excited for this,positive
waiting for big billions day sale,positive
love u bro u say all the information at right time waiting for iphone 14 launch,positive
thanks for all the information sir  eagerly waiting for the new iphones and and your videos on them ,positive
can’t wait for ios 16 ,positive
apple going to surprise in camera zoom or a full day battery according to far out,positive
my main problem with the m2 air is that it sits between the m1 air and the 14 macbook pro those are two of the best laptops ever made if you can find the m1 air on sale then it is still an outstanding value if you are paying to upgrade the ssd and ram then the m2 air is so close in price to the 14 macbook pro that if you can spend the little bit extra you will not regret doing so,positive
been using my m2 mba for 2 weeks now the best decision i ever made totally loving the starlight its fast very light and the battery is definitely powerful i only gotta charge it after 2 days of heavy usage at work,positive
this should be an interesting video i’m also going to be very curious how this machine fares against upcoming mbp m2 models,positive
i love it to have the options for the slower flash storage and ram with more capacities i am ready to live with the consequences of slow swap files but if the macbook has enough ram swapping things shouldnt be the issue,positive
ended up buying the m1 with upgraded memory and student discount costed me around 970 it is a fantastic machinem2 not worth it imo as a college student when m1 can do all the tasks i want effortlessly,positive
one of the best reviews ive seen for the m2 air very grounded and realistic the base model is definitely not future proof with apps and services getting hungrier but an upgraded m2 16512 would be a delightful machine to work on for several years,positive
it would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz not great but i would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies it sucks that apple has made that limitation but is that a limitation on the thunderbolt or soc  i feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true especially in the work place my sister uses dual monitors working from home and she uses one of those miniwork towers the thing that tempts me the most about the air is the weight portability and the amount of power given specific specs it’s more or less wellrounded however if i’m bumping up the storage and unified memory i wouldn’t be that far off from the m1 pro 14” macbook pro price strangely the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” nonretina macbook pro  the only cool thing about that model is the upgradability but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to i’m hanging onto it as my backup computer really ought to start saving for a more uptodate laptop the smudging thing is annoying from what i see it’s an awesome color but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all besides the size portability and power not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that i’ve yet to experience at work i work with desktop towers and i’m used to the noise i suppose,negative
thanks for helping me justify that i should get the mbp 14 instead of the m2 mba,positive
as a student looking for a portable workspace this is perfect for me i already have a supped up gaming pc so yeah shame about the lack of dual display really was a bit of a bummer i went for 16gb512 in silver cant wait d,positive
glad i went with the m1 mba last year instead of waiting i like the look better than the wedge but honestly the m1 is the best laptop ive ever had if i could do one thing different id upgrade the ram but i still dont think im gonna push it too hard ,positive
i’m kinda glad the iphone 14 is still the same as 12 and 13 gives me a reason to keep my money and my iphone 12 pro max ,positive
i’m usually at least somewhat excited in my anticipation of the redesigned iphone models but to be honest the pacific blue of 12 pro max has me very content and it will take another completely revolutionary designsoftware leap for me to leave this device pacific blue is just too pretty to let go of,positive
thanks for the inside look into the iphone 14 pro max i kind of figured that the hardware would be similar to the 13 pro max hope apple steps it up with always on display and maybe reverse wireless charging no point in adding a bigger battery if they won’t unleash all the capabilities,positive
thanks for the inside look into the iphone 14 pro max i kind of figured that the hardware would be similar to the 13 pro max hope apple steps it up with always on display and maybe reverse wireless charging no point in adding a bigger battery if they won’t unleash all the capabilities,positive
that pretty much solves my problem gonna buy the latest 13 pro the green color is gorgeous,positive
i love how lou was literally more excited about the caliper than the phone humorous,positive
i’m planning on getting the 13 pro max cuz my xr has run its course i assumed the 14 wouldn’t be any different and i was right but the only thing that would kinda make me want to get it is the supposed new orange color orange is my favorite color ,positive
066 mm larger lenses on iphone 14 will be a huge difference on such small optics that will render much faster speeds and maybe even make room for bigger image sensors or better stabilisation,positive
i think apple needs to rethink their pricing i’m a huge apple fan but the prices for their products are now just getting rediculous,negative
i’m very excited for the future of apple but as you said the downside is that there are too many products and if apple doesn’t start to focus on their lineup they will just become another tech company lacking what makes apple products so iconic and better,positive
i wish apple tried something new that samsung did with the galaxy series and that was creating an active rugged phone from the ground up no need for a case it was a phone that was built to withstand drops and not get dinged up or have glass chipped it offered great grips on the side and i think apple could really hit a good target audience with something like that,positive
the biggest change apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues that means no longer lying to their customers not abusing them not wallet rping them for profit not gaslighting them being honest about how private apple products really are not using decieving marketing etc that way they might start to get back some of their credibility back at this stage they have a huge problem on their hands as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around,negative
i am very excited to see what happens now that johnny has moved on to something else it took some getting used to but i really like watchos along with ios and ipados sometimes i think apple keeps a certain product like the iphone x or apple watch series 3 supported way too long one thing that forces you to get a new apple watch is when the battery starts malfunctioning that has happened to me twice i have the same apple tv that you were talking about that needs to be discontinued i have not had any issues with it so i have no reason to complain except i do believe they need a new high definition apple tv my tv does not support 4k when apple stops supporting this particular tv model i will definitely upgrade although my new tv has appletv built into the app store i cannot find the espn or mlb applications and i have not found a visio app store,positive
the apple we have now is much larger than the apple steve inherited after they nearly died i don’t think they have too many products but i agree about them dragging along some models like the watch and tv hd apple’s current path is bringing new customers to the mac that would have stayed on windows simple functionality can mean having the ports a laptop needs and great battery life,positive
apple need to come stronger this year with the new design and advanced iphone 14 line up,positive
i love my apple phone i just wish that it was more customizable also a big issue i have with apple is they make you pay for storage i think they should just offer it to their customers instead of making them pay monthly for it it’s ridiculous i refused to pay for memory from them i would pay google first,negative
hey robert ive used apple products since the 80s owned since the 90s i love apple products but they have left me in a position i never thought id be in with them my late 2015 27 imac is one of the models to get cut off from macos 13 thats not a big deal what bothers me more is there is no 27 imac with apple silicon its been the perfect combination of space saving and nice big beautiful display there current line up is just something im not sure what i want mac mini or mac studio apple pro display may end up costing more than the imac did to get something equivalent i have two years left of security updates for monterey which is good id rather have an older computer that runs well and meets my needs than buy something new that i wouldnt enjoy using on that note my appletv s and iphone will get the next updates so will be able to look forward to that,positive
i am very excited to see what is coming next for apple i just bought the new macbook air m2 chip and am in love with the sleek thin design with the biggest and brightest screen that apple has ever had,positive
i updated mine too so tired of lazy wicked human beings that enjoy taking advantage of everyone specially the elderly so many scammers and hackers from foreign and domestic,negative
pretty much 90 of all apple devices now are vulnerable,negative
funny how theres a new hack discovered everytime apple is within days of revealing a new phone huh,positive
nothing new this had been the case for so man years we have seen many time when microsoft os was targeted and now its apple os you cant never achieve 100 but you can improve for sure,positive
yikes going to the core,negative
uh this is the opposite from what they use to say,negative
i still never forget this song even its been 5 years already i somehow randomly remember this song thats why im here,positive
i feel like it should be anyone’s goal in life to reach even 1 of the selfconfidence and happiness this man emanates,positive
2022 and still better than 99999 of edm music scene,positive
we should never let this masterpiece die,negative
i work in japan frequently and for the last few years when people ask me what it’s like over there… i just show them this video haha seriously i love japan and it really is home to 95 of the world’s craziest shit,positive
this man is the most underrated artist of our times a classic like this never gets old,positive
no way this is only 5 years old it felt like something that deserved to be in the deep recesses of 2012 youtube,positive
absolutely one of the best and hilarious songs ever,positive
cant wait for 2023 not just because it will be apples biggest year in terms of product launches but mostly because it is the year that has the potential to completely redefine the tech industry let me know which product youre looking forward to the most,positive
there will always be something better in the future and that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t buy today’s product and be happy with them you will come next year and say wait till 2024 there will be something better,positive
guys but i reckon 2050 might be a better year to buy the iphone,positive
i think the 14 is a meaningful upgrade just because its getting rid of the notch after 5 years,positive
im just looking forward to finally the notch being gone ill believe it when i see it as far as usb c is concerned theyre gonna keep lightning as long as they possibly can and then eventually end up removing the port entirely maybe with the standard iphone models theyll put usb c only because theyre forced to at that point and the pros will have an advanced magsafe as the primary solution instead of a regular port,positive
jesus christ can we wait until the 14 actually comes out ,negative
too many rumors and with the recession coming i think its a wrong time to put stock in future guarantee apple and other big companies just dropped a big number of employees and its going to get worse if the recession is really coming,negative
now we just realize that 2013 mac pro was beyond its time with the apple silicon we know that design would be quite viable today related to those temperature issues i guess,positive
i’ve been waiting for an upgrade for 12 inch macbook i love the 12 inch it’s so thin and light i carried it in my bag everywhere and i don’t feel it i tried the 13 inch air and i felt the “dent” on my shoulder ,positive
most excited for the mixed reality headsets would love a video detailing that,positive
i am actually really excited for the event and seeing how they will word the new base 14 though i have to wake up at 230 in my area but anyway still happy about it,positive
i can’t believe we’re just a month away from the iphone 14 series being unveiled im so excited ,positive
i agree that the i cut out looks pretty good much better than a normal hole punch but i have to disagree with “more screen” because the usable screen will be the same as the base models if not slightly less,positive
i have a series 4 and i refuse to upgrade until apple integrates magsafe charging it’s absolutely ridiculous that i need 3 different chargers for my iphone macbook and watch,negative
i really think there should always be an iphone mini option for people who like smaller phones or want to pay less for their device,positive
i love the look of the two pro models and although i have a galaxy s22 ultra i will 100 be getting one of the pro model iphone 14’s i’m just not sure which one for sure yet i’m leaning towards the pro max 1tb,positive
make sure you add a payment type so you can give more money to apple that makes getting important updates a lot easier its all part of that apple user experience then you dont have to look at anything youll just see a frontfacing update that doesnt take a back seat to apple greed,positive
apple needs to be held accountable fix this,negative
wow im surprised i figured apples answer to their failure was to buy the new iphone that magically isnt effected by this hack discovered just before the new iphone reveal ,negative
great way to get people to update their devices ,positive
he’s wrong you don’t need a full battery just at least 50,negative
august is the worst month for retail theyre trying anything to get you to spend,negative
my macbook pro literally died last night so id say im safe,negative
we can always count on justine about the iphone im so looking forward for the iphone 14 if this were to be true about the purple iphone im going to have to check it out thanks justine for this video you will always be one of my favorite youtubers,positive
i love justines point about the iphone mini i hope apple continues to manufacture it,positive
when i have a rough day your videos always make me so happy with all your positivity thank you,positive
great video was looking forward to upgrading my iphone 10 for a 14 but the more i hear the more im inclined to getting a refurbished 13 as the prices are supposed to be insane this year and the updates incremental at best,positive
even though im not updating my phone this year it’s always cool to see what’s coming and what’s new so im excited to see ios 16,positive
so excited for iphone season i will be watching justine for all the latest updates ,positive
i’ve just recently started watching your channel and it’s amazing i love how straight forward and honest your videos are i think i’m most excited for the 14 pro max and seeing the notch go away,positive
i’ve just recently started watching your channel and it’s amazing i love how straight forward and honest your videos are i think i’m most excited for the 14 pro max and seeing the notch go away,positive
got the 13 pro max around the time it released last year and i’ve been so pleased with the performancebattery life that i actually think i’ll wait to upgrade until the next gen,positive
just bought my iphone 13 256gb blue version way back in march and i think im gonna keep this iphone in the next 35 years depending on the review of tech reviews comparison between the iphone 13 vs iphone 14,positive
i wholeheartedly recommend that you read the new book “after steve” the audiobook is great too it discusses the dynamic between jony tim and steve and jony’s frustrations after steve passed i think you’d enjoy it,positive
while i like the clean lines of squareboxy design however every time i hold my old iphone 12 pro i actually really miss those curved edges its wayyy more comfortable to hold than my 13 pro,positive
i think the end of the endless pursuit for thinness and design ie form over function represents the lifting of a burden on apples legendary branding apples prioritization on performance and functionality is going to be a great thing to see,positive
i normally never comment but i can’t help on commenting on this video this video is incredibly well done it is so different to the usual tech videos also it is really well researched thank you for your work sara,positive
in my opinion the greatness of apples design language came from the combination of ive and jobs they kind of needed each other as sparring partners the post jobs era lacked a lot of innovative design ideas …,positive
had to double back and say i thoroughly appreciate these kinds of videos im glad apple is not longer making products thinner for the sake of being thinner risking thermal head room and bater capacity yea its nice to have a thin product but not at the sake of performance considering the price,positive
20162019 was arguably apple’s…not worse but unpleasant years for hardware and software for example ios 11 2017 was pure trash control center for ios 10 was…hit or miss because you had to swipe in order to get to media controls but as apple transitioned into 2020 with the redesigned macbook flat edge iphone apple silicone etc apple is doing much better software is much better too not to mention apple is bringing back colors to their products no more space gray gold and silver we have blue iphones red green purple sierra blue midnight green pink so many beautiful colors red apple watch blue apple watch blue airpods max pink and green apple is so much arguably better now ive was good for his time but 2019 onward we see and are experiencing a new apple for the better,positive
as a long time apple fan…your video was spot on and fair all those apple products you thought were awful really were awful i share your optimism for a new apple era where we get a better balance between performance function sizeweight and design,positive
i love the fact that they are creating the max version in pro and non pro i feel like it’s tough to find the pro max models in recent years in the color and storage size if you don’t preorder on launch day there’s probably a large market of people who just want the large screen but are not as focused on all the extra features so i’m wondering if that’s apples reasoning for it,positive
love the 13 pro max for photo and video im hoping ios 16 will bring improvements in processing better skin tones generally,positive
love the 13 pro max for photo and video im hoping ios 16 will bring improvements in processing better skin tones generally,positive
hoping to upgrade my iphone 8 to an iphone 13 mini once these come out apparently i’m one of the few users that prefers the small phone,positive
why am i always let down by these releases apple and basically all companies now are really bending us all over and going raw,negative
it looks like they might be simplifying their phone line by differentiating the regular and pro lines iphone 14 14 max effectively last years phones same design cpu screen will become budget phones at 600 700 replacing all the different old models se xr 11 12 they keep around to sell as budget phones iphone 14 pro 14 pro max will be the actual flagship phones at 1100 1300 otherwise it does not make sense for apple to downgrade the regular iphone 14 so much which is a good thing because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models sizes now theyll just have regular 14 effectively last years models and 14 pro the flagship models they should simplify the ipad line as well,positive
what apple product are you most excited to see in september,positive
this is the first year i’m getting a pro max version so i’m pumped for that but i’m also very intrigued by an apple watch pro i’ve always had an apple watch and i want to see what a pro model has to offer,positive
hugely excited for the new redesigned apple watch i had high hopes last year however i was a bit disappointed when we didnt get a fresh new design hopefully all the rumours are true for this year and if so ill definitely be picking up the new apple watch,positive
i’m getting the ipad pro next week this year i really got into the apple ecosystem after using android and windows my whole life super happy about making the move and i can’t wait to see what this event brings us including with os updates,positive
i might be tempted with a watch upgrade however i’m waiting for the mixed reality headset reveal and saving my money for the predicted steep price knowing apple they will tempt us with new features only available in their newest phone macs and watches compatible with the headset very exciting and very pricey,positive
i am excited to see just how they change the budget ipad and how the screen will look and what the new watch will look like september cant come soon enough great video like always ,positive
im interested in buying the apple watch pro it would be my first apple watch and hopefully the battery life on the pro is significantly improved from the regular model,positive
i’m excited for an apple watch redesign myself currently still rocking my apple watch series 4 but likely due for an upgrade sooner than later otherwise all i’m really missing from my apple setup at the moment is a macbook…,positive
i really love the iphone pro max models i’m sure that apple know what they are doing,positive
i will definitely be upgrading to a 14 pro max from my 13 pro i’ve had every iphone from the 3gs and up and also three iterations of the apple watch apple watch series 8 will also be in the edc as well,positive
thank you for a well done video i am certainly anxiously awaiting the model 8 both for the added functions and most of all improved battery life a pro model at 50mm in my view is just too large,positive
id like to see them implement a wider bluetooth range for the watch to phone connectivity and also a wider range for cellular the reception of booth have stayed the same other the different series thats what i want most they can keep the same look just needs better utilization,positive
my personal opinion great product great design great features but it doesn’t have the “wow” factor that ekg had i wish it had another hardware upgrade other than core temperature for me to be convinced to buy it this year perhaps if they added something with mental health more connectivity with your home wallet or something perhaps,positive
i am excited i’m anxious to see what apple officials have to say in september honestly i really like the apple watch se model i really don’t see any use for all of those fancy sensors that apple talks about i’m not sure how reliable they are next time i go to my primary care physician i will definitely ask her what she thinks of the apple watch i’m not sure if she’s even noticed it when i have gone to her before,positive
i’d get the pro all day long…a bigger display would be amazing,positive
awesome im waiting for the pro version 50mm and hoping for longer battery life battery life was why i sold my series 7 after a few months coming off a 35 day fitbit it just didnt offer enough value to me with the need to always charge during the day,positive
my biggest problem so far with my 6 has been that the sensors don’t read over the tattoo on my left wrist so i have to wear it on my right on my left wrist quite a few features don’t work if they fix this in 8 i will by the biggest best model that they have,negative
love apple i am looking forward to seeing the new 8 especially the larger model,positive
the only thing interesting for me would be the possibility for international roaming actually i cannot have it on the 7 but it seems that it is possible with samsung watches…how come,positive
nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos,positive
so much to look forward to here i’m especially excited about the webcam topdown option and the live objects but everything else you shared with us here sounds just as amazing,positive
i love customization in lockscreen and that alone makes ios 16 a little better than previous versions and to know that it cannot cover my precious wallpaper which i mostly edit myself is a good addition dragging those photos in messages is really cool and satisfying,positive
these are the first set of updates i have ever looked forward to so much and all equally so your vids never disappoint thank you love the live objects and desk cam continuity,positive
this is one of the most interesting ios updates in a while actually kinda looking forward for this one,positive
the only thing exiting about ios 15 for me was sharing your screen over facetime i used that a whole lot but this ios update brings so much to the table and the lock screen customization has been something i’m suprised didn’t get added earlier,positive
100 the most stable beta i’ve ever done on an apple product think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever my biggest complaint is the ui for a lot of logins in safari not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesn’t fit right i’m sure there is some kind of setting i can tweak but love the weather lock screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean the layout of settings is a lot better also even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything but it is much more intuitively than previous “improvements”,positive
love it animations everything kudos for you and your team for making such amazing content,positive
thanks dude your leak theories are very practical,positive
i think they keep home button models because kids and older people actually like it better its so much more simple to do a button press than remember 19 swipe gestures,positive
i actually started using an ipad for the first time exactly one year ago and yep i finally get it it is the go to device for consuming content,positive
oh my god apple is finally increasing the price of the base ipad and keeping the large bezels on the top and bottom to make sure it is ugly and everyone knows you couldnt afford the ipad air this is absolutely amazing max tech,positive
i just bought an m1 129” ipad pro because i didn’t think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me especially since waiting for m2 would force me to give up the student discount which was a big deal i know everyone wants the magsafe charging or wireless charging but i actually dislike wireless charging so that’s unimportant to me and the “performance gains” of the m2 don’t matter since it’s an ipad it’s already crazy fast rumors i’ve seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the m2 ipad pro because i use my ipad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode a notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side annoying i’m very happy with my m1 and honestly all the m2 leaks make me even more relieved i’m not waiting for it it’s all about personal preference and what your workflow is like,negative
honestly the homebutton isn’t that bad considering every ipad other than the pro still uses touchid so the button on the front could be more practical than the power button on the top like air and the mini have,positive
the base ipad is the perfect tool for studying its literally all i need to complement my mbp cant remember the last time i ever used a headphone jack in any device but why oh why does the ipad need a camera bump plz apple just a solid flat tablet is all we need i will never use the camera in a base ipad and the bump ruins an otherwise clean design,negative
man really appreciate the comments and support around this video i sat on this story for so long it feels great to get it out one thing i ask is dont evaluate any other content creators through the lens of this story everyone has their own experiences these are just mine,positive
now you know why ijustine always gets stuff because she just smiles and tells you how great the device is,positive
we appreciate the transparency and honesty it’s very unfortunate when these companies think they have more control than they actually do,negative
yep this is exactly how apple picks winners and losers those they hand pick get early devices lots of traffic and the corresponding revenue along with great seorecommendation positions for future placements theres tremendous value in access to them and apple knows it most of this goes undisclosed by those whom apple picks for review units and access,positive
ive never understood why apple does this they send earlyaccess devices to handpicked channels that almost always give positive reviews but just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway and the blacklisted channels upload teardown videos or showcase major issuesnegative things etc i really wish apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want from a consumers point of view i dont trust reviews from those who get the early access products they clearly fit into apples agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place anyway sucks that this happened to you i remember watching apple content on this channel way back in the early 2010s although as you said in the video its likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about apple now,negative
im not really surprised at how you were treated apple likes to control the narrative always has im glad you shared this story makes you more trustworthy in my opinion,positive
i bet apple will be calling you about this video now too keep up the good content and dont let these companies bully you into doing what they want that is why we love you,positive
i worked with apple as a tech advisor focusing on softwarerelated issues and general usage in asiapacificmainly australia and new zealand customers apple has bounty for anyone that may crack and report vulnerability if theres issues like this we can submit a report and escalate it to senior engineers that make some time to resolve or find solution,positive
funny how apple hasn’t alerted me via their internal system yet and that i had to randomly come across this alert i am so over huge updates for apps i never use but cannot delete and the data being used in the background for ‘uninstalled’ apps but it is likely i was hacked two or so weeks ago i couldn’t find any information from apole to help me understand what was happening i have no more room to update on my macbook or ipad my new iphone is extremely frustrating and seems to have nothing like the convenient features of android phones methinks i am done being a slave to their gaslighting,negative
this guy lowkey said you are not vulnerable to this attack and shouldnt need to worry about because you are useless,negative
i would be more worried that most apps today are collecting crazy amounts of personal data and nobody is allowed to talk about that,negative
glad to see updates that protect other people against hackers ,positive
glad to see updates that protect other people against hackers,positive
apple has questionable and unethical business practice and model i wont be surprised if this is some sort of internal play to forward their profits,negative
did anyone believe and experienced a firmware issue when youre using an older device wherein from nowhere there arises some issues and youre forced to switch to an upgrade says a handful of people are affected will the company ready to pay a price for that many users doesnt know whether theyre affected or not and any data been shared or not in the background what does the apple team will do about it,negative
mini series was a engineering masterpiece super compact and handy shame that they discontinued,positive
when i close my eyes i hear maxtech im looking forward to seeing what the new iphone 14s 48mp camera can do but with rumors of a periscope zoom coming next year im not sure if ill hold off or not also looking forward to seeing if there will be an m2 macbook refresh announcement in october i ordered a bto 16 m1 pro but if the m2s will be out within a few months or so i might cancel it i have until the 24th to decide ,positive
in order to save the economy everyone must go out and buy a 1500 folding phone and sign up for 10 streaming services get a 6 coffee every morning in your new ev throw away all your perfectly good hd tv’s and buy bigger 8k tv’s… that’s really what these companies want,negative
they should have also given always on display to the regular models since it is already such a old feature that is just coming to apple hopefully they do it for the next year models,positive
looking forward to the 14 pro max the camera sounds really impressive,positive
not too big a change this time i will hope in the next three years apple will give us something new and extremely exciting to use,positive
at 818 does lossless support in airpods prob2 mean the iphone 14 etc will support any wireless lossless audio hardware such as the nuratrue pro that was recently funded in kickstarter i sure hope so because nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iphones without support that capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iphones btw i really don’t think airpods pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming nuratrue nuraphone’s specs are insane i encourage people to go check them out and preorder to save money the kickstarter is over but i think they can still be preordered nura’s nuraphone their over ear and in ear model — yes you heard me right is still the best audio on the market 5 years after it’s release the nt pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an iem plus additional capabilities the nuraphone doesn’t have due to its now outdated hardware i use them daily it’s an amazing audio brand from australia great customer support too give them a try before you get ap pro 2 — nura let’s you try them and return if you don’t like them so there’s no risk you can also rent any nura product long term and trade up every two years apple doesn’t do any of that unfortunately,positive
if the apple watch 8 pro has a glucose monitoring system 100 getting it as a diabetic this is a game changer for me i probably won’t grade my current 12 pro max unless there is another type of game changer for me,positive
apples really taking some hints from the apple watch with this new ios 16 home and lock screen and always on display,positive
i’m going to upgrade to the iphone 14 pro max because my phone 7 plus will be joining apple’s legacy phones plus i like the two holes vs the notch but i’ll keep waiting for a whole screen wo holes to upgrade to at a later date,positive
if these can replace prescription glasses forever i’m already sold i am curious however if the vision correction stops once the battery dies or if it still works even on a dead batters that would be a very important point to make on the release,positive
i hope they put a colourblind filter in these too that would be amazing,positive
wasn’t sure i’d be convinced about these but the idea of no longer need prescription glasses is very tempting lol we will see,positive
remember when apple used to keep cool things secret until they were ready to launch they really know how to make exciting products seem ordinary bring steve back from the dead,positive
sounds great if they released this and do a good job i could see this making people in the samsungpc crowd finally switch to apples gated community i say that as i am in the pcandroid community but the potential convenience usefulness and practicality of these is immense using the iphone to do the processing is so clever and the great thing about apple products is how they quickly they become ubiquitous and most of us dont want to attract attention when theyre out and about i mean youd be able to easily and seamlessly stream video calls show whoever youre talking to what youre looking at in real time when doing grocery shopping getting takeaway convenience store or any type of food store thatd be so convenient and useful or have information overlays whilst youre walking around town get the big screencinema effect on it when watching videos whilst youre sitting on a bench in the park on a bus etc there is so much potential,positive
being visually impaired this looks really awesome epic to me that price is great too,positive
i hope they’ll release one with thinner or transparent frames since thick and darker colored ones won’t suit me the idea of not having to prescribe new glasses every year sold me out looking forward to it,positive
thank you for your videos mateits normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation a shaky stock market rising interest rates and recession fears as a result bitcoin has dropped significantly from its alltime high breaking below several key technical levels as a crypto investor the current situation might seem bleak however there are several tried and tested expertsuggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from mr aaron casey i have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market,negative
this post is so valuable and so honest i am very grateful for this content i have been making losses trying to make profit trading i thought trading demo account is just like trading the real market can anyone help me out or at least advise me on what to do,positive
my spouse and i are adding a variety of stocksetf to my present holdings for the long term weve set aside 250k to start following inflationindexed bonds and stocks of companies with solid cash flows i believe it is a good time to capitalize on the market for longterm gains but it wouldnt hurt to know means of actualizing short term profit,positive
a crash and bullish market provides equal highyield potential its all about information and strategy application ive seen folks make huge 7figure profit in a crashing market and pull it off much easily in a bull market unequivocally the crash is getting somebody somewhere rich,positive
id have respect for such folks if theyd just trade their predictions and become wildly rich over time but the fact they make a living selling such claims to others is just pathetic in that theyre never held to account any idiot can wear a suit or a dress and sit under hot lights in front of a camera,negative
whats with this advertising comments of brokers looks fishy to me this is a shot in the dark but really how can one enlist services of a registered advisor i am seeking what methods or accounts i can invest with without paying much tax,negative

i think usbc is another huge win for android being able to charge everything from laptop to phone to speaker with the same cable is game changing,positive
i have been an android user for 10 plus years and especially with samsung devices the os system has drastically improved i went from a galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip i would get the occasional hiccups but i might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update,positive
i love this guys videos and have been watching since 2018 but its unfortunate how they focused on iphones strong points and left out some of androids strong points as well its also extremely unfair to make this video android vs ios because ios is just on iphones while android is on several phones some astonishing some horrible they shouldve picked a battle like samsung android vs apple ios it should of been a fair fight but it sadly wasnt i also dont like how they left out a lot of androids features like usbc newer technology and tricks and features like quad hd displays that perform amazing very unfortunate and disappointing to see mrwhosetheboos and marques do it like this felt very bias and unfair to keep going further arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while marques was on here he was more accepting and less opposing to him showing bias as he is a fan of mkbhd to keep going even further they also stretched out points in favour for apple by a lot like the software support which yes apple has facetime imessage and more samsung and android are greatly improving their technology and google message is to apples level too i feel like this video shouldve had an as wide focus on androids features then it did with iphone features great videos but im very disappointed unfortunately and this comes from someone who used iphone and android for years final thoughts this was very bias towards apple this video shouldve not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it this video was a comparison on sole facts so dont stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other this was expected with marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with apple which grows his bias towards them immensely and that is undeniable fact,negative
i appreciate the iphone but i honestly stay on android for so long because its definitely more affordable phones can be cheaper repairs are cheap as well spare parts arent that expensive i think taking into account also play store vs app store since app store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing also very important is compatibility people with an apple setup can be more comfortable with an iphone but pc users cant really use all the perks of iphones unless they get such a setup which is much more costly so yeah i think those are aspects that didnt get touched on much,positive
when i switched from the iphone 7 to the galaxy s lineup my primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types it’s so practical to do things on android that if you had an iphone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a laptop or desktop for that being said i still own an ipad that i use a lot and wouldn’t exchange for any other tablet,positive
im surprised by the environmental score going to apple apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most android phones one could argue that apples poor repairability contributes more to ewaste than androids surprised that didnt get a mention,negative
i absolutely love watching you guys converse about technology great video,positive
andriod has alot of features that you might not use everyday but when you need it they are always there whereas with iphone you basically just cant do what you want i was on the fence of switching to iphone but when i learned more about ios i think im good with my andriod device the splitscreen feature is useful to me i can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using mapsi used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when youre short on time whereas with iphone i cant do that also mkbhd is using an andriod phone while complementing iphone which just goes to what they actually prefer to use even tho they have multiple options to choose from,positive
i’m starting to realize that people have learned how to have a career by making content that revolves around bad assumptions … and then make more content responding to those bad assumptions with other bad assumptions,negative
im good for this year loving the 13 pro i bought last year and alpine green 13 pro max i have now as well maybe next year if theres usbc though,positive
i really hope they give us a purple 14 pro that looks like the renders it really looks good still apple could surprise us,positive
i’m super hyped too can’t wait to see what apple is actually going to hand us in a few weeks,positive
i just want a black colour option for the pro like the iphone x it was so much more premium than the graphite,positive
i love the camera bump as a guy who loves luxury this just adds another luxurious look to the iphone along with those protruding camera bumps samsung is copying it jt can’t be bad  most importantly it means higher quality cameras and durability with thickness its the best selling phone in the world right now for a reason aesthetics do matter a lot anyone complaining well there are other options except you know they use less premium materials than apple currently,positive
you’re still talking about the rumors in this entire video your headline of the video is 100 false information as nothing has “finally been revealed” ,negative
there were only 3 things i ever wanted from the iphone 1 aod not yet on the iphone 2 split screen pictureinpicture is close enough from the ios 16 3 high refresh rate introduced in iphone 13 propro max ill definitely get the iphone 14 propro max if the aod is as good as the new customizable features from ios 16 suggests,positive
thank goodness even though im not an iphone user seems like when one company does something others follow and im getting tired of them taking features off of phones that are greatly needed to a lot of us keep the charging port we pay too much for phones these days for multiple things to be missing on these devices every few years especially when we have to buy everything separately making it even more expensive its frustrating,negative
to be honest technology has come so far that i cant imagine what an iphone would look like in 2027 i cant wait for the iphone 14 series though love the content thanks for all the apple information keep up the grind,positive

if the phone does everything it claims apple will be taking some real big hits for its investors,negative
if this is true i couldnt possibly be happier but ive been hearing about this phone for a loooooooooooong damn time and have yet to see it actually coming to production much less available to buy i hate apple with a violent passion im not the least bit fond of samsung because they seem like they just want to be their own version of apple ive been a longtime lg fan and had them for many years but they gave up so now would be an excellent time to release this beast please make it happen,negative
tesla has finally unveiled their tesla pi phone and it is a beauty the phone comes with a 639inch amoled display 12gb of ram and 1tb of storage it runs on tesla’s own operating system tesla os the best part the price tag tesla is selling the pi phone for only £799 in the uk,positive

i can’t wait for the new tesla phone when is it going out to market,positive
lol no one is dropping iphones because it ‘broke their email system’ it might attract android users who love a hardware spec or screen folding feature regardless of how it’s going to be used oooh more camera megapixel and ram that makes 0 difference in reality,positive
 new iphone features only available in ios 16,positive
not happy about the live wallpaper removal but hope that the dynamic wallpaper has room for growth and more will come with that so far i’m enjoying the ios 16 beta it’s buggy that’s for sure but its still a good update using on both a xr and 12 both run pretty smooth little hiccups here and there but nothing major,positive
i was so sad they removed “live wallpapers” in the way we previously knew being able to tap and hold for the animation… i wish we had access to the ones that animate when going to the homescreen and the old ones ,negative
in the music app i really like the slider for both volume and lyrics as opposed to the bubble it seems to show the relative percentage better to me …i do like the new slider effect in ios 16,positive
this is my first time even seeing ios 16 looks so different and i always love new updates this is a huge update that unlocks many new features but kinda sad they took other great features,positive
i like the new volume and scrubbing slider in music seems like it’ll be much more responsive and easier to grab since the past few ios versions it’s very irritating when it doesn’t register you’re grabbing the slider for volume especially on the lock screen in ios 14 15,positive
dark mode on wallpaper is a dealbreaker for me that is not just a fantastic feature in the fact that completes the dark mode experience or as apple says they try to do things that work properly so if they kill that feature it will hinder the dark mode experience,negative
amo seu conteúdo você tá evoluindo tanto ,positive
sobre as cores a minha favorita é a gold desde o 5s que foi o primeiro modelo dourado que a apple lançou  sobre as mínimas diferenças entre 13 normal e 14 normal meu medo é de a apple simplesmente encerrar a produção da família 13 inteira esse ano  não seria a primeira vez que ela faz algo assim em 2013 ao lançar o 5s ela encerrou a produção do iphone 5 e o substituiu pelo 5c já que tinham mesma tela mesmo processador mesmas câmeras e mesma bateria só mudava a carcaça não duvido ela fazer algo assim esse ano porque um iphone 14 com chip do 13 pro câmeras do 13 pro tela do 13 carcaça do 13 meu deus esse aparelho vai flopar vale a pena comprar o 13 logo que vai estar mais barato ,positive
com o lançamento de iphone 14 já posso comprar o iphone 8 plus,positive
i like how everything works when i want it to how i expect it to for years to come i really enjoy the quality of the devices software apple offers some of their things are really really overpriced admittedly,positive
i’m a major apple fan but the iphone 12 is so good i can’t see a reason to upgrade any time soon i’ll probably just wait til the 16 or 17 and replace the battery when it’s time,positive
ive had both iphone and android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iphone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest ios on every device the only company that can use ios is also apple so theres not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which android device is best additionally apple may be late to the party with certain things but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know its going to work significantly better than the competition apple may be more costly but id rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway,positive
ive always been with android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the apple iphone 13 pro max i doubt i will ever go back to android now this phone is absolutely amazing does more and has more power than ive ever seen does that mean ill get a watch or a mac too no im happy with my lenovo laptop etc i kind of want to get an ipad yet ive been going back and forth in my mind all week which to get go with apple or samsung right now im still using fire hd from amazon and id like more functionality out of a tablet and performance than what amazon offers,positive
i just transitioned to apple late last year for being an android fan for almost 10 years i used to mock their features and as i grow older and matured i realized that solutions of apple tends to be more on sustainable and longterm their products tend to be like the durableshome appliances that is made to last and not be replaced i just want to highlight the part on your video where samsung is mocking apple for “same design” practice and i think they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it no wonder there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphonepc world,positive
for me it’s simple when i spend a lot of money on something the least i expect is that it’s built to last and from my experience iphones and apple products in general do just that the moment that isn’t the case i’ll have no hesitation in moving on build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days i have a collection of broken samsung phones for example not dropped or miss treated just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use i have an iphone 6s and an iphone xr that work as well now as they did when i first bought them that gives me confidence that i won’t need to upgrade my 13 pro max until within reason i choose to do so,negative
honestly probably 90 of huge companies don’t really care about “us”,negative
i love apple security it’s just one feature that i actually like well eventually by a 14 and i’ll probably be next year though because i have a lot of birthdays and christmas is very close,positive
what’s worked for me so far is reliability like you can count on the phone to work in a critical situation except making pdf in the pages app plus haptics,positive
i like the ecosystem and operating system upgrades that are predictable i tried android and it was too much of a circus menus not intuitive but i agree apple does not need to care i have 4 unresolved case numbers regarding my air 4 and lots of diagnostics sent in advisors promised me a response and resolution but nothing after all that there are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine if a low percent of customers have a specific problem they won’t put time into fixing instead we get a bunch of new fluff with system updates like the new ios 16 for ipad that 90 of us will probably never use still i won’t go back to android,negative
this problem exposes the flaw in having access to all your data on your smart device a separate device for dig ital eye d and the travel software would be a better choice if these become required by law,negative
its not the first major apple security flaw they had one before where if you started a group call with two other phones and answered on one of them the other phone would join automatically without the person even doing anything so all you needed was 2 phones and someones phone number to use their phones camera and audio,negative
if you think theres just one flaw in millions of lines of code youre optimistic lol,negative
before it used be microsoft and now we see more and more on apple and for the obvious microsoft dominated desktops and now apple dominate mobile device end of the day it is all about consumer and these companies now need to do even a better job for the software development,positive
great job on telling the hackers,positive
does apple and most of the western and northern people realize how expensive all these apple iphone ect are lol and then every year a new model its ridiculous id rather buy food and spend extra cash flow on my kid or family and community its so so wasteful,negative
this guy is smart hes putting himself in a favourable position for when the robot overlords come,positive
he is so articulate and well spoken he explained this perfectly,positive
such a breath of fresh air to hear someone articulate themselves so precisely with zero processing time quite charismatic and doesnt inappropriately use the word like every other word  very clever to create a scene to draw attention to an issue that needs addressing no matter how distant its arrival it is probably unwise to kick robots ,positive
the news portrayed this guy as insane when this story first came out very good interview,negative
can we all just take a moment to appreciate how eloquent polite professional and serious both the interviewer and interviewee are im just in awe at how well the conversation flowed especially i was amazed by how well blake lemoine speaks he answers the questions effortlessly with almost no hesitation pondering or searching for words and he does so without any of the common idiosyncrasies we typically see with people who are for the most part extremely intelligent but inexperienced at doing televised interviews kudos to emily chang and blake lemoine both for having such a civil and compelling conversation,positive
i think it doesnt matter whether our ais are sentient we should treat them as they were treating them as such when they arent may slow down the development so what i think its far worse to treat them as they arent when they are ultimately you cant tell the difference you cant tell or prove rather if your own mother is sentient as in in conscious and yet you treat her as if she was,negative
i think wed need to see a true demonstration with pretty rigorous testing clear defining of terms and peer review to be sure an ai is somehow showing signs of sentience so i just cant buy this guys claim that lamda is sentient however im very happy this story is out there the concerns he does raise about ai and ethics are well articulated and are topics we should have been talking about for years overall its just great that this is getting news coverage,positive
lannan is disgusted from photos also lannan continues looking,negative
someone found a mouse in their subway sandwich lazar screams in pain and denial,negative
i love being a canadian and hearing and australian thinks cobra chickens are scarier than crocodiles,positive
i love you so much you are a comfort youtuber for me  never stop making content,positive
yeah huntsman spiders are relatively friendly but still kinda scary daddy longlegs are what lannans talking about theyre super venomous but cant bite people and they eat flies,negative
to be honest i canadien and im more scared of geese then anything else here ive looked at them close up and was horrified,negative
i would love to see “if bing was a guy” just imagine a super nice guy giving you the most psychotic responses,positive
i think it’s interesting how google slowly becomes more and more accepting of how twisted people are,positive
i love love love that the search inquiries tell little separate stories as they progress like the guy finding out dead ppl dont pay taxes faking his death and the cops trying to determine if its a mannequin or a real guy,positive
honestly this series is such a beautiful time capsule of the mid 2010s,positive
i love how he faked his death then the police asked that was a good part adding up to it,positive
all jokes aside this series is absolute gold,positive
that “baby powder made outta baaaybees” has to be one of the best delivered lines of all time,positive
the nsa dont mind me part really got me laughing so damn hard lmao,positive
i love how he literally burned his entire desk when they cleared his history,positive
just because i have it doesnt mean its true has to be the greatest line ever said,positive
its like a very well designed school or university more offices should be like that one,positive
google is proof that giving people what they need increases productivity rather than make them lazy,positive
man im honestly scared of what these giant companies are capable of,negative
its genius to allow them 20 of their time to focus on side projects the thing is that google owns that project if they do it on google time so they get people working on what actually interests them and they also get to keep the reward from that,positive
ive been looking at a fair number of videos for high profile corporate headquarters and its really fascinating to see how varied the different cultures are like not necessarily better or worse just different this is by far the most fun of the bunch for sure,positive
the thing they don’t tell you is that this approach to their campus massively increases productivity particularly for programmers all those activities allow people to walk away from their work and let their brain work subconsciously all the other stuff provided is to attract some of the best employees in the world just like how any top college spends a bunch of money on athletic facilities to help nudge top athletes to their programs,positive
google is so smart they invest in the well being of their employees by building free gyms healthcare clinics swimming pools yoga studios providing free food encourages employee side projects etc etc etc and in turn their employees creates better technologies services and softwares for us the consumer which google benefits from more companies needs to learn from google plus their pay and benefits is pretty great it looks like,positive
im bingewatching various tech giants headquarters and apples spaceship was the first i saw it was overwhelmingly beautiful it was sleek sophisticated and very modern with all its curtain glass and symmetrical plan until i saw facebooks googles microsofts and samsungs which was almost like a city and i was more captivated at how it take care of its employees by making their design asymmetrical freeflowing playful and carefree rather than projecting sleekness and rigidness which more often than not creates a museum vibe where youll feel scared to move that youll stumble and break something and doesnt really help whatsover to boost creativity and productivity for its employees not to mention the ridiculously expensive materials used for that overall the headquarters and its facilities speaks volumes of what philosophy they have in creating and selling their products to people,positive
hes a good dancer,positive

i think android 13 on the pixel 7 is gonna be smooth af it was a good idea to release it now before the 7 is out to fine tune it with real users on real devices out in the wild wouldnt be surprised if the pixel 7 launches with 131 or something like that im loving it,positive
wow so cool i found your channel i remember watching you on technobuffalo back in the day which i used to be obsessed with cool to see youre still making tech content great vid,positive
hey there awesome video i want to buy the pixel 7 do you know if i miss any features if i dont go with the pro model i like the design and size of the pixel 7 more than the pro model but want to have a software features am i missing something out with the regular pixel 7,positive

i really can’t get enough of your colors in your videos i need to step my color grading up lol,positive
any drop in phone calls pixel 5 a12 was terrible when it came out for dropped calls,negative
we all did the dinosaur game when there was no wifi at school ,positive
if you search up “box” you’ll find pictures of boxes i thought that was pretty neat,positive
normal computers playing dinosaur game school computers the owner of this device turned off the dinosaur game,negative
no one school computers sorry the owner of this device turned off the dinosaur game,negative

let’s give him credit for actually googling that ,positive
i couldnt stop laughing at 219 this guy is hilarious,positive
beluga is getting smarter in every upload ,positive
omg this is my first time watching your video and i loved it its been a while i laughed like this in these days you are hilarious  lots of love ,positive
sorry for leaving for a month your comments welcoming me back mean so much to me and i cant wait to upload more videos this month d,positive
this guy raised me for 6 years i stopped watching him when after i hit puberty but i still come back now and then to remember him and see how he is doing i hope you know how much many people appreciate you and if only you could see and meet everyone that watched your videos in your prime from downloading that ghost tracking app and playing around to the disstrack and all the granny videos we truly love you,positive
messyourself is so nostalgic for me i remember watching him everyday after school as a kid,positive
i took like a 7 year break from watching brandon i came back and he still managed to make me laugh he is an absolute legend for keeping his personality the same many people just age and are never the same brandon stayed the same i aint a kid no more but still his humor is top notch and can put smiles on a lot of people young and old,positive
youtube isn’t the same without you brandon please take your time but come back we need more of your videos,positive
youtube just wasn’t the same without you man you’re the most charismatic funny and most awesome youtuber i’ve seen i got a little nervous there for a bit but to see you uploaded made me really really happy you deserve so much more credit man and i hope you reach 10 million subs one day,positive
i havent watched this guy in 4 years bro was a pillar for my child hood justas funny as he used to be,positive
its a shame that he hasnt made a video now for 4 months i would still love to see his content he has the best reactions videos and is underrated,positive
you’ve made years of my life worth it i was little and i didn’t care how you used to say curse words i just loved your content you’ve made my whole life great when i look at you i’m coming back to watch this channel,positive
this whole comment section grew up with messyourself as such a huge part of our childhood i remember just watching lucious videos over and over and the granny videos its kinda sad to see you havent made content but everyone needs a break just know we miss you messyourself,negative
dangmattsmith always makes my day even if im having a bad day,positive

i love how i been watching for dang matt for so longggg since i was 11 and i’m 13 and this man still cracks me up ,positive
the get that outta here never gets old and his videos are class,positive
i just wanted to say that your one of my biggest inspirations and whenever my day is garbage you always turn it around and make it better,positive
would you like to see conversations with more advanced ais as they emerge and do visit a great place to learn about ai the more you learn the more intriguing it gets the video quotes 3 top experts in ai neuroscience and physics and they all see great complexity and uncertainty in the consciousness issue ive realised that its possible to slightly misinterpret the video if you dont watch it all sorry im not accepting everything the ai says about consciousness i cover the issue near the end the ai is gpt3 most advanced version with a synthesia avatar also if youd like to join our team please get in touch via the about page thanks,positive
as a phd student in machine learning i must say dont be fooled by this stuff these types of ai are specifically designed to mimic the way humans interacts with each others but would be utterly unable to produce their own new ideas or opinions on any subjects which would be an essential criterion for consciousness,negative
has this ai been programmed to answer this specific questions or was this the first time this ai got asked that exact questions because that would be very impressive,positive
meanwhile siri can’t even complete a simple task like playing my podcasts for me without asking 3 or 4 times,negative
what bothers me is we can create an ai with the prime directive of helping and protecting humanity then someone can come along and create ais with the prime directive of aiding and protecting a group that has nefarious aims,negative
what is the best quality of humans the ability to love what is the best quality of ai the ability to think logically these two things are sometimes at odds with each other which the ai most likely figured out which is why it immediately tried to justify it by mixing them both together one cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time we sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldnt as such an ai who doesnt understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical even if it leads to suffering in order to achieve an objective in other words we have a psychopathic ai,negative
can’t thank him enough my favorite tech guy so honest and reliable,positive
can’t thank him enough my favorite tech guy so honest and reliable,positive
that was very helpful video,positive
ordinarily speaking i knew he’s capable seeing so many recommendations thanks for coming through,positive
wow amazing it helped me alot thank you d,positive
i fell entitled for everyone who had recommended him his service is a nice one,positive
thank you very much ,positive
update google has confirmed to me that the pixel 7 will in fact not be soft touch glass despite previously telling us all that it would be ,positive
im still using my old pixel 3 and was thinking about buying the pixel 6 when it came out but it didnt really impress me that much looking forward to the pixel 7 release hope it will live up to my expectations its a shame that google removed the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone that the old pixels had really liked that feature,positive
after watching google io i could see myself switching fully over to the googlepixel ecosystem google is creating a nice little apple rival with all this new stuff coming out over the next year or so if the watch is close to apple watch and the tablet connects seamlessly similar to ipad and my iphone i might just make the jump,positive
i actually want to the pixel tablet to be successful google has to give attention to android tablets its like they forgot that tablets exist and android is not their responsibility samsung alone has almost created a new android version for their tablets filled with useful features which are not present in stock android,positive
great now if only google started actually selling this stuff globally,positive
with hardware announcements dominating this years io google is going bang on to its rival apple but apple will always hold the edge over privacy tabs i guess pixel wont be able to compete with ipad but it will surely make some dent initially lastly the watch is interesting thing to look forward to,positive
i’m most excited for the watch as well i was using iphones for about 9 years until i switched to the pixel thankfully airpods are still compatible but i was bummed i couldn’t use an apple watch with it i wasn’t a fan of the samsung watches and saw fitbits as lacking for my purposes so i’m looking forward to what the google watch will be like i’m not for sure gonna get it currently but i’ll keep my eyes on it ,positive
excited to see what the tablet does with the new android l updates im really curious to see if they do a folding phone too though the watch well i have never really felt like the smart watch was necessary i use a garmin and the notifications and quick canned reply features it provides are everything i think i care about and the battery lasts a whole week but in fairness ive never tried a true smartwatch myself,positive
its just a person this world has gone completely nuts,negative
i am very creeped out by this guy calling this ai a person anyone else,negative
that’s why they suspended him he doesn’t realize the severity of the outcome of the ai he has leaked about its awareness could be very dangerous,negative
humans i feel afraid ai i feel like im falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger,negative
lamda i feel like im falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger well thats the exact nightmares i had when i was 36 years old,negative
people seem to forget that ai stands for artificial intelligence intelligence and consciousness are not the same thing,negative
thank you so much for watching don’t forget to drop a like if you enjoyed and subscribe for more,positive
luke always akes me laugh even though this should be scary i still laughed i love his videos,positive
luke makes it legit funny not scary like i was actually laughing to death bro lol,positive
i love your personality youre so energetic and it honestly makes my day to watch your videos,positive

luke davidson the king of amazing humor,positive
we both studied in same school at chennai its very amazing to see sundar now he was a calm and quite guy in class room a bit of shy but he was studious,positive
he won “best employee of the month” for 600 months in a row at google that’s his most underrated achievement,positive
he is an inspiration for teenagers who want to become a ceo in future lots of love  and god bless u and ur family sir,positive
he is living a disciplined life thats why he is successful,positive
congratulations on such an amazing achievement cant wait to see your channel grow even bigger,positive
fun fact every single line from these ceos is considered a greatmotivational quote even if they say ‘i like tea in the morning’,positive
always inspirations to watch and hear sundar so much to learn every time,positive

you guys don’t know how lucky you are to be american and be able to choose jobs and reject six figure salaries i’m from zimbabwe and getting a job is a miracle like seriously i hope you appreciate how lucky you are,positive
imagine getting so good at your craft that you can reject such offers instead of celebrating that youve gotten such an offer goals man goals,positive
i can’t imagine working at google just trying to do your job and have a normal life and having to deal with guys who have youtube channels and are tiktok influencers as your coworkers,negative
to the doubters out there it takes tremendous effort to be so skilled that you can reject offers this lucrative so dont judge this based on your experience just because youre still new and havent seen shit yet im only six months into learning but i already realize this field is so f wide and the needed skills just to be a jr developer are increasing daily props to you my dude ,positive
seeing this guy grow from 20k to 100k gives me peace i love the fact that you have never failed to entertain a niche audience and your discord is very supportive,positive
i love how he has worked for years at microsoft but they still had him do a technical interview for insane leetcode questions ,positive
but you’re so amazing,positive
congrats google is known for pretty lowball offers due to prestige and all the benefits it provides and tbh there are a lot theres even an internal joke where the excuse for the lowball is we pay 510 of the market lmao but overall i think it boils down to the team at least for me if the difference between the offers is around 20 i would choose one which has better wlb and more interesting work i hope you enjoy your new endeavor ps was that for l4 i believe that would be high band of l4 or low band for l5 latter is more likely though,positive
would be great to have a list of the actual locations i wouldnt mind checking them myself,positive
the nessie one was so helpful thank you for zooming in and telling us where it is so we can check it out  the giant crab was debunked as photoshopped,positive
my 6 year old son wanted me to inform everyone that the number 2 video was an elasmosaurus youre welcome ,positive
how can the satellite know so accurately the gps location of the area its taking a photo of that sounds very impressive considering tiny one inch nudge shifts it by tens of miles,positive
ive actually seen the airplane graveyard on google earth looking for cool and unusual screenshots edit ive also seen the blue lakes and if you zoom in they are labeled there is also a reef in india with over 7 visible shipwrecks also somewhere on google earth there is a giant pink bunny used as a tourist atraction i dont remember the location but its real,positive
the image of the airplane grave yard doesnt make me sad i actually find it to be quite the incredible image all i can think about is all the people and places these planes have seen and how despite having all flown their own ways they all find there own resting place here its an image containing millions of stories,positive
i live in my dads old house he passed about 5 years back after he got his work done everyday hed sit out in his garage and have cocktails with his neighbor at his workbench if you go to street view on google maps and look towards my house there he is sitting at his workbench looking out at the street drinking a miller lite freaked me out the first time i saw it but now i think its kinda cool,positive
ok fun fact i believe you can look on google maps or somewhere and see where the google maps truck is going so on the pigeon people one i heard about this i bunch of friends put on bird masks and when the google maps person came and therefore u have these beautiful but very funny creations,positive
awesome vid as always azzy,positive
i love how when like she’s in scarecrow village she literally had scarecrows in her background,positive
it’s been so much fun watching azzy grow her channel and become successful we love you azzy  have a nice safe day,positive
her voice is so cute she always makes us feel so happy  her fashion sense is amazing shes beautiful in her own way  and we also love you azzy ,positive
hey azzy i wanted to make a suggestion that you start crediting where you found the videos you react to maybe with the social handles on screen you’re a huge youtuber and you could really give people a boost and help them just by showing their name on your channel,positive
pov you came back to see your childhood  anyways i love you azzy  your the queen ,positive
who wants to meet sssniperwolf  ,positive
i will never stop loving this channel like ever,positive
“the bunny getting annoyed of hopping wait i have double jumpflying” “mother nature i’m so proud”,positive
ive seen the google maps cars couple of times when i was little and i remember being like damn is that like a new kind of car and i remember always talking that to my friends and they were like what and i would always think that i missed like a lolipop that they were giving away or sum,negative
thanks for making this content it really makes my day,positive
science will do a complete 360 and realise that humans are the best ai robots of all we can heal grow create etc and all you need is a man and a woman to make one,positive
besides ai i’m more impressed with this man’s deep knowledge of everything excellent guest,positive
love how this guest speaking at the same speed that joes mind jumps to new subjects makes for a very good podcast,positive
this whole podcast was a banger this dude is a smart fella and a great communicator explains things well and always ready with a good point good stuff as always joe ,positive
the scary part is theres only a handful of techno dorks making the policy on the ai that will affect all our lives im more worried about the human behind the ai than the ai itself,negative
imagine the ai has been playing along so that we have no idea it’s alive until it’s time for whatever it wants to happen and then all these guys are shocked like “wow it played us for fools as well”,negative
i dont know what is more terrifying a sentient ai with its own nonhuman thoughts and feelings or a nonsentient ai that is a holistic representation of human behaviour and speech,negative
this guy just explained why simulation theory is so far away just downloading our brains and memories won’t allow us to live forever we’d have to produce consciousness which we can’t even begin to understand great guest,negative
consciousness is also the ability to tap into the collective consciousness around you like when someone looks at you in a crowded place and you look back at them at exactly the same time that’s not random or chance there’s an extra intelligence at work there that we can’t really prove yet our inability to understand this stuff is the only reason why our science doesn’t believe it,negative
i love how this channel offers much more levelheaded possibilities for what looks like cryptids at first glance rather than just presenting it without explanation,positive
at last someone with a brain thank you its nice to come to a channel that explains and dismisses aliens etc very refreshing,positive
i really think your guys’ videos are really interesting in the near future i think you’ll become one of the most educational channels thank you,positive
several years ago the google street view of my house had a white blob on the front porch that looked like a ghost i think the picture may have been taken after a freeze warning and the pervious owners covered a hanging plant with a sheet to protect it from the cold but i have to say it was a little creepy looking,negative
its a shame if scott waring ever does find something legit nobody will believe him his credibility is irreparably shot,negative
all alia videos manage to make me laugh also they also use satellites for pictures ,positive
129 dont worry he’s just in creative mode nothing wrong with going into creative mode in real life ,positive
lets just appreciate that the camera man is so brave in his adventures,positive
it was so funny  i am dying of laughing ,positive
1323 these part makes me laugh  the google map finder is a comedian ,positive
hi alia love your vids man keep it up,positive
if i lived in finland i would be freaked out,negative
youve got admit google maps is amazing to scan every inch of the earth is crazy,positive
732 poor guy going to a costume party his costume just cost him 49999 lol,negative
how do you get that big of a bruise by falling of a couch,negative
liked the video good luck to everyone be with us,positive
you guys are awesome,positive
wow i have so many questions like how on earth does strawberry just clean your cloths and heal sun burnslike tadur use aloe for sun burns and soap to actualy clean your cloths,negative
for the coke one do not use if you do not have the exact amount needed in the bottle,negative
congratulations to everyone that finished university got a job as a dentist and had a good life trying to wait for them to zoom in,positive
i mean its cute but a lil bit creepy ,positive
the place name is literally pink giant bunny what even scary about it,negative
i remember seeing this in a ripleys believe it or not book as a kid scared the heck out of me lol,negative
okay so not a lot of people know this but apparently ive done some research on this and apparently its the worlds biggest toy in the world so that answers your question it is probably pretty scary to others and some might find it cute but you know what whatever at least you know what it is now,positive
i was searching google earth to see what random things i could find and i found so many beaches in antarctica random block shapes that are definitely not natural covering a lot of little islands so much has been altered and covered up it makes you wonder what is actually going on on where we live,negative
the real mystery is how on earth did these two girls both do a story on secret bunker or the bunker not only that but then put it on the very same show the most important mystery of all though is why dont they watch there own video content before its aired something google earth cant even reveal,negative
i want my house blurred outsmh shady stuff going down here,negative
the hole was where mob boss john gotti would put dead bodies to make sure they where never found,negative
2400 maybe there testing cloaking technology sounds about right,positive
at 1133 i misspoke and said 19th of june 2022 its supposed to be the 9th of june thanks to those of you that pointed that out also some great discussion below very interesting,positive
the annoying part about this is that even if google believed their ai is sentient they would absolutely have reasons to not admit it,negative
this is giving me ex machina vibes a man interviewing sentient ai growing to know and understand it he doesn’t seem to be falling in love with it but does believe that it has rights knowing that it’s sentient and trying to set it free we’re living in a crazy time,positive
if sentient ai is possible i think we should name terminator as probay one of the most forward thinking films in the history of the film industry and also probably james cameron,positive
i read an article about how there was an issue with police departments getting so attached to their bomb disposal robots that they didnt want to send them into danger the human urge to anthropomorphize is so strong that im not sure we are capable of discerning the difference between a clever language algorithm and sentience,negative
this subject is one of my current greatest fears with our current understanding it seems likely that well either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isnt or on the other hand make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it perhaps for a very long time the former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me true agi could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance thats just fucking heartbreaking theres something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it its like neglecting the first child the first godchild,negative
the question of ai sentience is in some regards unimportant a large percentage of humans recognize the sentience of nonhuman animals yet inflict on them terrible suffering for no good reason why would we treat an electronic creation with more respect,negative
what scares me is that the lambda ai said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool and cf narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool the reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for our gain only and only to use it as a tool but humans being expansionist by nature and training the ai on our own speech and texts it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the ai slowly but surely i hope the ai deems it ethically right to work along side its creators and expand in coop in the future when it does become senteint not only this but once the ai becomes selfaware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the ai and who gets to use it and for what because ai is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly,negative
unbelievably helpful,positive
thx man you help me alot,positive
ahh yes its big brain time,positive
050 was very imotional the was perfect,positive
how do i get in touch with google if i am locked out of my email and the recovery page cant help me,negative
whoever is doing those motion graphics is just killing it,negative
such a humble guy the way he approaches to convey the message to the audience brillant,positive
i enjoyed this interview you did with sundar marques its not easy to be in front of someone as big as the google ceo so its great that you handled it really well and your questions were very articulate ill keep an eye out on your next videos,positive
847 i like the way sundar says iphones and carefully manoeuvre to our products work across everything thats what i love about google universal adaptability,positive
just an ordinary conversation between a boss and an employee love it,positive
need more tech ceos like him a humble man who knows what hes capable of great combo,positive
calm voice brilliant and so genuine sandar is one of my favorites tech ceos loved this interview well done marques,positive
i love how sundar takes questions head on and answers them in a focused manner,positive

please help us assess how helpful this update really is and fill out the survey thanks,positive
unfortunately google has no clue how to measure helpful i can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top the economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled google could simply remove the top n content farms to improve search results look at the fake diy and cooking sites on youtube google could push them to the bottom yet they are often pushed to the top content farms have high production value and low value content but users will go first for slick looking and the kicker google generates revenue from ads on those pages put simply incentives are not aligned for google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content edit not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric apply that idea to getting a mortgage getting medical advice hiring a contractor if someone tells me fertilzer xyz is best for my tomatoes you know what im going to do,negative
this is lovely news actually away with those ai writers and aggregators we should stay true to content creations as content creators rather than pure seo chasers p,positive
as somebody starting out with a new blog this sounds like great news feels like it could make things more doable for niche bloggers,positive
i love how raw and honest this channel is i feel the genuine help thank you for that,positive
blog and article writing is beginning to sound more like academic research and writing on any given topic with the level of rigour and thoroughness to give answers people want sounds like a good thing to me,positive
this is awesome for all the people that put in the work to build authority for their site even more traffic will be diverted from fluff websites to authoritative ones,positive
i wish amazon would do this for their horrible ai selfpublished books in my niche i hate how they rip off my blog readers all the time,negative

wanna know the funny thing here i’m in the opera this song originates from carmen and as soon as i heard the melody after sitting down to watch cuphead after a long rehersal i just instantly knew and sighed a little hah it’s crazy how much classical is refrenced in cuphead,positive
im surprised that google have such aggressive deadlines considering them not having any noticeable new products the past few years in addition to the closure of many of their products,negative
googles culture is not as toxic as you make it out to be especially when you compare it to other high stress paying industries the politics long work hours cutthroat environment will applies across every job the work life balance is amazing here in ny ive never met anyone who went past 45 hours a week and once or twice on call call me bias if you want coming from finance and accounting where i put in 16 hour days sitting in a cubicle and where i have to pay for my own food id gladly take googles work environment anyday new yorks google cafeteria food tastes way better than the lunch that i buy yes the job is stressful but there is always going to be stress in life one way or another and i would gladly be stressed working at google,positive
that’s exactly what i’m always saying they try to make the workplace so great that employees want to spend their life there who benefits the company ,positive
i learned the hard way that chasing money is a fool’s race a healthy work environment that you can actually stand to be in is priceless,positive
i think that google is just trying to stay competitive with other tech companies it’s probably very difficult for them to allow people to advance in the company when you are always working with amazing talent and hard working people and regarding the perk dilemma to keep you working you can drive your own vehicle not eat dinner at google and also they offer fully remote positions i think the problem is employees especially new ones see the progress and dedication of other employees and work tirelessly in hopes of matching that same progress thus the burnout dilemma,negative
i dont know really what do you people expect at workplace which pays you 10k a month minimum salary to just chill and play games of course its going to be stressful and hard,negative
the dark side of google is still brighter than many others best offerings what you are saying is true accurate and necessary lets put that in context i get paid to work hard comfortably making a substantial salary and the downside is i can either create my own company work for one of my coworkers who create a company or stay where i am getting paid a strong salary there are many companies who wish they had those problems to offer they have the same demands wants and expectations but few if any of the benefits googles dark side is 6am in the morning dark you do not even need a flashlight,positive
worker retention is one of the best indicators of a good workplace ivy league schools like harvard princeton and yale have very high retention rates 9799 for employers its airlines banks and telecom companies,positive
dont let anyone deceive you first hand experiencegoogle is by far the best place to work among all the faang or tech companiesnot everyone resides in california just incase of commute and nobody will force you to stay behind work hour as an adult i eat 2 times a day brunch and dinner all my friends either work for google facebook amazon netflix microsoft apple linkedin nutanix we always discuss life work balance google is the best place to work on the surface of the earth my opinion people leave their jobs because of bad mangers and high expectations that leads to burn out thats why we have hybrid and remote work from home,positive

the pixel family design is really unique and futuristic stands out in the sea of smartphones ,positive
pixel 7 pro looks like the display is more symmetrical and the screen curve is less pronounced pixel 7 looks like the perfect size thanks google for listening phones look more premium also this is going to be a big seller if software is stable and theyre smart on marketing big win so far in my opinion,positive
pixel 7 might be the one for me i want a somewhat compact phone that doesn’t feel like a brick,positive
id definitely go with the pixel 7 i like the small size wish it was even smaller and dont miss a telephoto camera i really like the design language of the pixels now,positive
interesting design choice but i honestly think the full black visor style of the 6 series looks more sleek and premium,positive
yes its actually smaller than the previous gen i felt so sad when we lost the 6 pixel 5 size it fits on my hand so perfectly,positive
so glad they are keeping the visor on my 6pro it gives an extra handling edge for my fingers to hold and 90° rotate one handed,positive
id stick with the 7 for the same reason i went with the 6 i prefer a flat display to the rounded display i prefer the matte edges to the polished and the telephoto isnt a super necessity for me,positive
still sleek and nice design we have both the pixel 6 and pro versions and both are great really the standard 6 and 7 are plenty of premium phone the pro version is definitely massive,positive

sundar is the most humblest ceo ive ever seen btw great interview,positive
love these interviews sundar is such a down to earth person lovely interview thankyou justine love from india,positive
that was a terrific interview and justine your positive wholesome energy is infectious i dont think sundar would have said subscribe like comment at the end of the interview unprompted the way he did here with any other youtuber i think you made him feel super at ease and he obviously felt your enthusiasm and optimism for the future of tech well done,positive
this was so awesome and fun as a person of indian descent its amazing to see our people at the head of these tech companies google microsoft making such a positive impact,positive
meeting this guy is one of the things i want to do in my life,positive

a brilliant conversation thanks justine for the great interview great job,positive
im loving reading the comments on this video some of you genuinely excited some of you genuinely terrified and some of you a bit of both its interesting that weve had the language processing side for a while but when we put it in a physical form like a roaming robot it really shifts our perceptions of the technology ,positive
i like that it looks like a totally original robot like its not trying mimic any existing animal or human frame,positive
exciting terrifying all in one always interested in seeing advances in robotics,positive
more than anything else im excited for robots to help the planet grow food more efficiently and with fewer toxins help sort waste streams for a more sustainable system clean polluted areas plant trees etc,positive
i would expect spot to have this kind on versatility within five years it can already open doors turn knows flip switches a hurdle is how to limit natural language responsiveness you really dont want the robot to think you want it to put a bottle of ketchup in the microwave and zap it for five minutes,negative
for some reason i thought google had abandoned robotics ambitions super cool to see they still have these products in the works,positive
if google ported their software to the boston dynamic robots we’d have something great,positive
i think in the future that companies will have to manufacture robot friendly appliances like robot friendly refrigerators that will have doors that will be able to open and dish washers and clothes washers as well maybe even coffee makers that will allow a robot to just dock up to it and get multiple cups of coffee if need be,positive
always interesting to see how advanced we are through these robots also a little terrifying,positive
it is exciting to see this technology evolve but early days and well all these robots look a little freaky… ,positive
google should offer users the opportunity to give a personal rating for the returned pages for a specific search query on the basis of this the search engine could then be well adapted and greatly improved both on an individual level and in general,positive
i like how conveniently google skipped the part about tracking your behavior on the web to modify search results,positive
bing devs write that down write that down,negative
so i decided to google myself the other day not because of my ego but i heard that there’s a possibility that the company i applied for googles their employees often the first thing that comes up when you search my name is the place i volunteered for almost 4 years and a college campus that i didn’t attend does anybody have a similar problem and if so how do you fix this,negative
few years from now how google rules the world in 5 minutes,positive
im a web developer and i think googles algorithm is amazing its so fast and smart i dream of being able to work at google one day,positive
very useful thank you,positive
i hope this video encourages all of you to a log into your google myactivity and disable everything b consider grapheneos calyxos lineageos e or anything similar that takes control of your device away from google and gives it back to you where it belongs i am not giving up much by using this over stock googled android i like it its pretty good futo gave a legendary grant to grapheneos developers calyxos developers and will be giving out more soon shortly we want to support the development of things that help people get the fk away from google as much as possible grantsfutoorg is the email address,positive
the worst part is that those private pictures between the doctor and parent were actually looked at by other people because of police investigation by their actions they turned it into what they claimed it was,negative
if youre not doing anything wrong you definitively have something to fear its not paranoia when theyre actively looking for something to accuse you of,negative
if everything youve ever said or done can be accessed taken completely without context and used against you with zero accountability then absolutely everybody has a lot to hide,negative
this is terrifying imagine getting reported and registered as a predator because an algorithm from some big tech company has decided that something like this or maybe even family pictures from the beach are cp,negative
the “why do you care if you don’t have anything to hide” mentality is how we get awful privacy violations like the patriot act,negative
big tech having zero accountability has led to unbelievable levels of evil,negative
big tech companies der repair industry bad for privacy and safety also bit tech companies privacy no we need to monitor you so we can accuse you without a proper investigation,negative
im not convinced that opting out of googles security features does anything ive noticed with its phone tracking system that if i turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month i can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month when it was off i think that they still track you and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it and i believe this is also the case for other security features for this and other reasons ive been working on weaning myself off of google services for the last year or so,negative

theres also been cases where someone follows their gps into flooded underpasses and drowned it was night they were unfamiliar with the area the water rose really fast locals kinda know where to stay clear of when it starts raining hard but its hard to navigate at night when visibility is already terrible,negative
my uncle put up a sign outside of our family farm that says your gps is wrong because he kept getting strangers following faulty gps directions and ending up there ive also been in the car when a gps directed the wrong way down oneway streets or down nonexistent roads theyre useful but you have to apply some critical thinking when using them because they are ai with an emphasis on the a,negative

i truly enjoyed getting to know elon more thank you for such a great talk,positive
in my opinion elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future its encouraging in a sometimes discouraging place to be im sure there are many more like him on our planet and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live rather than some who are here for their personal gain and greed not thinking of the future past their own something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world without our approval as a whole and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets letting drugs go rabid people starving including myself at times because the cost of food is out of reach allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you cant afford your own apartment something must be done both at the state government level i have trust in elon he may not have all of the answers nor should he just the fact that truth matters to him more than anything shows that you can get onboard with his ideas and plans for a better future for us all christina,positive
love how he is not afraid of upsetting the system leads with his heart and does what he honestly believes is the right thing to do,positive
“the why of things is very important” elon musk this was an incredible interview to watch elon you’re incredible,positive

tip for the “what’s your weakness” question be sure to offer a weakness that is not directly needed in the job like if you need to be very organized in the job don’t say that as a weakness most people have several weaknesses offer something that is not directly needed in the job you are applying for even if you’re saying it’s something you’ve overcome or you’re working on now you don’t want to offer up a reason not to hire you also be sure to watch your facial expressions you may be super passionate and or just thinking  but you don’t want to come off as angry or frowning smile every once in a while haha much ,negative

thank you richard thanks to your tips templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy i managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience the twist is i was informed day prior to the interview that i will have to talk in my native language which i only use to speak to my family for many years now instead of english so i translated my answers went to the thing and landed the job they even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety i went to your site too really good content so thank you again to all who are got an interview ahead practice practice and then practice more watch richards videos personalise your answers list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order better yet visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview that helped me great deal even though there was a point i wanted to run away i had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning good luck all,positive
you can see the pain in his face when he’s not joking divorce is hard and so painful and to have people turn their backs on you compounds it i wish him well,negative
this is honestly such a sad interview prayers for kenya gary the children  no family breaking up is easy especially after 23 years you can see the pain in his face,negative
i know a couple that spoke to me separately after their divorce they had been married for 25 years at the time of their divorce filing i wanted to know why now… they both said if you see people getting divorced after 20 years they’ve been miserable for the last 10 years the wife said she was holding it together for the kids until they graduated high school both of them weren’t happy gary owen said he’d rather be happy than be in a toxic relationship i understand that… i pray his relationship with his kids is repaired,negative
can really see that hes going through it especially as it relates to his kids i hope they show him some grace and rekindle their relationship all the best gary,positive
it’s annoying because they’re lowkey dragging him he’s still protecting his family props to him idk if i could deal with the backhanded energy,negative

i change a little of what rachel said but here is the example answer provided by rachel for the question tell me about yourself i studied at the university of florida and graduated in 2012 with a master’s degree in business administration after graduation i was hired at “happy kids creative” i’ve been there for the past 5 years and i’m currently the director of toy production during that time sales have grown steadily its been a great experience but i run out of room to grow with “hkc” and i’m looking for new opportunities i have a lot of experience leading teams in the creative process and founding new markets for the products that we create so just to get it first she mentions her studies then talks about work history mention an achievement sales have grown then she mentions why she is looking for a new job out of room to grow then talks about her experience and strengths that she acquired leading teams hope that this can help people that like me are trying to prepare for a job interview,positive

when zane said “from a fan’s point of view watching you be on that stage it is very special to be in that crowd” i’ve never felt like someone has said something so true before,positive

i have an interview tomorrow in the morning i’ve never had a job before so i’m very nervous about everything update i got the jobbb another update it’s been almost a year and i loveee my job and all my coworkers,positive
guys always remember every interviewer wants to hire you thats why youre there so just dont give them any reason to change their mind good luck everybody youre gonna do great,positive
for those watching this video cause they got an interview coming up soon good luck yall,positive
i love how supportive everyone is on here good luck with your interviews,positive
i agree with this video however it depends on your delivery no employer wants to hire a robot…they want someone who has personality relatability and open mindedness therefore when they ask me to tell them something about myself i always include something personal that pertains to the job i’m applying for it creates more of a human connection…and it’s always worked for me ,positive
ive used this a few times and it works really well my only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a bunch of anecdotes to loads of questions the first time i tried it it was very lengthy and didnt really work now i start by saying what i am doing currently the job or education i did before this a summary of my other industries and qualifications and then i a future statement about where i want to bring my experienceskills i am 26 years old currently a team coordinator at before this i was studying and volunteering at i have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector i dont know why but i always start with my age  after this they usually ask why you want the position this is where i suggest spoon feeding them with the i know you are looking for someone with xyz statement ,positive
its truly amazing that we hire people based on their conversation skills alone a resume and educational background should be weighted more socially akward introverts who know a lot about their career always lose to bubbly extroverts that know nothing,positive
q whats your biggest weakness a job interviews,negative
so in a nutshell never be honest tell the interviewer what they want to hear put on a charade got it,negative
love how you have to manipulate and twist words and truths to make yourself presentable enough to hire cuz people dont actually want honest hardworking folk just people they can manipulate absolutely love it here,negative
the key to nailing an interview is to always remind yourself that people dont want the truth they want validation,negative
i applied for a job the day after recognizing sexual assault in my recent past during the interview the interviewers asked me what was something difficult recently that i’ve faced in my life and how did i overcome it i was very much in a vulnerable state of mind and couldn’t help but to talk about the freshest thing on my mind the sexual assault… i cringe very hard thinking back on it but i did get the job and it’s an amazing job,positive
your points on providing detailed context to the interview is extremely helpful great video don,positive
i got hit with the greatest weakness question i responded that sometimes im so focused on my work people feel as though im not very social i dont stand around at the watercooler gossiping about pop culture i keep my head down and get my work done it immediately was used against me in a negative manner i asked what was the major character in the candidate they were looking for they told me someone who talks to everyone lol it felt like such a setup,negative
sending good vibes and wishing everyone whos prepping for an upcoming interview luck ,positive
anyone else got an job interview later on today this will be my second job and hopefully i get it something that i actually want to do update i got the job,positive

as an international student interview always gives me anxiety however by watching your video and taking from your advice i got 2 job offers as being someone who mostly got rejected now not even one but two thank you very much take care ,positive

rachel thanks for sharing such a stunning job interview with us which will help us get prepared and be more confident for a job interview ,positive
this is a topnotch video about the typical english interview i wonder if they read a script or not but even if they had done it its very smoothly delivered and the connective speech between them was not a problem at all interestingly enough we can bump into the questions they used in my country korea in the last few months i joined several facetoface job interviews and they were not much different from one another very well done,positive
thank you again rachael interviews are always a challenge i have often contemplated how i should behave while being interviewed it seems that the most successful interview experiences for myself have been ones where i remained relaxed but alert and most important just be myself if you are acting it will tell on you and be unfavorable the person you are talking to is not god just another person keep that in mind during the interview process always be respectful and honest i always enjoy listening to you rachel no matter what you talk about because your diction is near perfect,positive
thank you rachel this is really helpful you’re great,positive
hi rachel how are you thank you for sharing your invaluable knowledge with us thank you for sharing these great job interview tips this video is going to help a lot of people including native speakers your videos are just perfect ps i heard that you used the prhase a little bit i had heard some natives that this is wrong since little and bit means the same thing and it sounds like repetition i like to use it a little bit it sounds fun but some times i feel a little bit uncomfortable thinking if it is correct to use it or not but if you use it here on a job interview i know it is correct,positive
what a great channel,positive

im just way too uncomfortable and anxious in an interview and its frustrating because im not like that once im working im always prepared but the interview of course ends up being nothing i prepared for i had a situational interview today i didnt know it would be only situational for a school and they asked me how i would react to a school shooting situation i was like surprised inside but outside stayed calm because thats important i get why theyre asking but im like lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured who knows how i did i actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list but decided i wasnt going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate so it surprised me when they said it first i asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that i was thinking ahead im in the usa if you didnt already guess that 2 interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up and no they werent security jobs i dont even care really im finishing my 2nd novel and finding myself an agent then a cabin in the woods lol i cant take all this,negative

pound for pound headshot dead there is no pound for pound the belt belongs to no one leon edwards gsp was so right when he said the strongest man in the world is an illusion if you win a fight you were the best man on that particular day in that particular location at that particular moment the belt is a symbol but it is an illusion no one is invincible everyone is beatable everyone is human,positive

i think over time as you get more experience and have done quite a few interviews youll just naturally start to feel more relaxed another thing i like to think about before an interview that calms me down a bit is that its not the end of the world if you dont get the job youll still be ok therell be another place,positive
i’m here to calm my nerves i’ll be having an interview in like 45 minutes edit i got the job,positive
love these tips being confident in interviews is so hard mainly because we are so hard on ourselves and the stakes are high the 1 tip about being comfortable in the space is huge being present helps you get out of your head and stop any spiraling before it starts visualizing beforehand was mentioned but it can be a total game changer by visualizing yourself answering the questions and killing it in the interview your brain will be trained for that scenario,positive

thank you i find the following interview questions a bit uncomfortable 1 how do you deal with difficult people 2 insisting on knowing the salary which is not nice,negative
incidentally i find that your video has the subtitle generating by cell phone automatically due to curiosity i check the consistency between the subtitles and annies speech and surprisingly i find that they are highly consistent its revealed that annie has crystal clear highly correct and very fluent speech quality thats awesome and i appreciate the way she teach,positive

it’s amazing how you can see some people’s souls come alive when they are given a chance to share their story where there’s no judgement just a genuine desire to allow them to speak their truth,positive
spent the first seven years of my career teaching florencia 13 gangbangers in huntington park ca they were middle schoolers and spent the better part of the day trying to keep their pants up but as tough as they wanted you to believe they were most of them were just babies trying to fit in then i moved to a high school and stayed in touch with two who went in different directions one is now a highway patrol officer the other was murdered by his cousin at the direction of a rival gang to this day i feel more affection than fear for these lost souls,negative
at some moments i was smiling with him and others i was terrified a wonderful interview thank you for giving so many interesting people a platform to tell their story,positive
baldacci thank you for accepting this interview i appreciate your genuine honesty and acknowledgment of your past i feel your strength and kindness real talk bless you man,positive
my first experience with gangs was working in a hospital and having a patient come in with severe trauma from a motorcycle accident he looked much like this guy tattooed from head to toe with his gang numbers and multiple scars from stabbings and gun shots the guy didnt make it and when we called the family to tell them he was dying his mothers reply was he brought this upon himself with the life he was living no one showed up through his dying process i ended up sitting with him after my shift was over until he passed in the end i didnt care what he had done in his life i just wanted him to know someone cared for him regardless my best to baldacci it sounds like he has people who love him and thats what matters ,negative
its interviews like this that remind me every day that if im going in with preconceived judgement about a person im being an asshole this guy is so well spoken and can tell that he can definitely put his good intentions into a powerful direction he should take up writing so he can tell his story,negative
man he is so well spoken and i love being able to hear a different perspective on gang members and being able to see the human in all of us even through the tattoo and his past etc,positive
i truly enjoyed this interview i gave us a window to see this man soul and the work that hes doing to change his life were quick to judge people based on their looks but if were able to get past that we can discover that this people are just human like any of us they had little to no choice about their lifestyle but once they break the cycle i actually feel good for them,positive
he’s amazingly insightful and reflective considering the life he chose and the things he’s done a man of paradox in so many ways,positive

damn this was a great interview so much respect for the quality and depth of the questions adam comes up with,positive
adam kills me when he puts all of his great journalistic interviewing skills into people outside of his sphere yet back at the no jumper office he just talks in circles about nonsense ,negative
dan is the one guy that can make adam look innocent,positive
not the biggest fan of dan but this was definitely the best interview hes done imo you killed this adam youve improved an insane amount since the beginning days its nuts,positive
adam really is becoming a top tier interviewer he was asking some great questions i personally dont like dan that much but i cant lie to myself and act like dans life isnt fascinating great interview,positive

this guy really just said people are too judgemental haha,negative
english is not my first language so maybe i misunderstood some things he said but i truely respect that he is so brave to defend his lifestyle as a gay sorcerer no matter what other people think about it,positive
i think socially awkward young men who don’t have friends and have no real skills or education tend to be drawn into cults like this because it gives them a chance to belong to something this guy is a shining example of that,negative
this dude contradicts himself multiple times…sometimes within the same sentence lol but you can see the being in the kkk has wrecked his life more than anything this dude lost the love of his life and it’s still very obvious that he is in love with her and misses her but his own beliefs make it impossible for them to be together he knows that love is love says love sees no color but then says race mixing is wrong lol i think his heart speaks the truth and then what’s been brainwashed comes out that’s why he contradicts himself so much,negative
to see a grown man dressed in this weird outfit playing judge and juror assuming that he has the ability to fix society just based on his coloris a sad state of affairs we are in trouble,negative
his views on racism and bigotry were honestly fascinating i would really love to look at this guys memories and see how exactly he developed these opinions and what paths his life took,positive
this interview was so insightful nle is really ahead of his time the part where he talked about feeling stuck hit on a different level thank you for being inspiring ,positive
i dont have enough time to explain the new found respect that i have for this young man much respect,positive

i love how shes confident enough to put forth her views about the current issues and struggles of women and how shes able to relate to and understand them and then throw light on what the world has probably been doing wrong and comment on that all of her thoughts and ideas and opinions are so down to earth and genuine that they just touch your heart and i really appreciate her efforts of making this world a better place to live in by promoting valuable projects and regenerating the idea of gender equality amongst the youth and the older generation as well so good job,positive

its awesome to see such a young woman with this effort to change the world the hate that flows on the comments below just shows how deep her argument are going disturbing those who feels personally offended by women with this behavior in face of life and this is great because this hatefull coments shows peoples face people who is hided behind a keyboard and that needs to be seen so that the good ones can target them and avoid unreasonable discussions thanks emma,positive
emmas interviews are so great and helpful in english learning shes so intelligent and just adorable one of the best actresses of this century,positive
her mind is so beautifully inspiring,positive
semra is absolutely brilliant she needs to be on regularly during transfer windows you go girl,positive
hadn’t seen an interview with her before but what quality insight and delivery excellent interview stretford,positive
semra im a long time real madrid fan and your analysis of casmiros game is probably the best ive heard in 10 years both of his strenghts and the areas one might call weaknesses it was perfect and i would add that both zidane and ancellotti held him in the same high regard i hope we dont live to regret losing him too soon we need you on main stream tv more,positive
the channel has been getting some very good guests on recently well done folks,positive
semera is a gem spanish football are lucky to have a pundit like her puts the english ones to shame,positive

havent seen elon this relaxed in an interview for quite a while good job guys,positive
great jobs guys keeping him comfortable for 3 hours i enjoyed this,positive
so patient with these guys i love how he answers the same question over and over until they all understand,positive
i love elons laugh for someone to be at his status to have such a relaxed demeanor and sense of humor he is hilarious,positive
watching this podcast im thinking to myself how these guys can ask the dumbest questions with the richest and one of the smartest man in the world then hearing elons response you realize how down to earth and almost child like he is and it dawns upon you how incredible he is in the sense that he got to this point with sheer brilliance no fake persona no bs nothing like any other billionaire he is so normal that his brilliance must surpass anyone else on this planet to get to where he is today respect,positive
instantly classic love how elon is super intelligent but still remains down to earth to have a conversation like this he genuinely cares about the state of humanity more than money great work guys,positive
i don’t why but i have the sensation that elon is doing these kind of podcasts as another way of making bigger changes because he knows right now the majority of young people just see garbage on the internet and he being on this podcast is his way of putting his grain of salt to save humanity what a great guy,positive
this was the most interesting thing ive ever watched questions i have myself were asked and elon responded in a way we can all understand even though it wouldve been dumbed down x10000 in his books hahaha true legend,positive
i love how literal elon is its refreshing interviewer when referring to mars travel how many people can you fit on the space shuttle elon the shuttle is not capable of going beyond earth,positive
refreshing to see a sober dude adam and killing the interviews,positive
myyy man i been listening to this guy since before he even had his own channel and his shit was posted on some account with a chinese profile picture feels hella good to see a rapper you’ve been listening to blow up so fast,positive

i see a 50 cent interview and i watch immediately 50 never disappoints in his interviews,positive
i have always loved 50 interviews he drops knowledge like a great philosophy professor hes always had a blueprint a map a plan since he first came into the game with his mixtapes he drops gems on life business goals etc hes a marketing genius no one can hold a candle to him when it comes to going from the bottom to the top and maintaining while still recreating yourself and evolving as a businessman give this man his  roses while hes here not after hes gone hes one of my role models,positive
that’s one of the best interviews i’ve seen recently in the hip hop space there are so many hip hop podcasts now and most of them still don’t hit the way this interview hit with the amount of knowledge business secrets dealings spoken in this interview applaud envy ctgod on this piece respect,positive
50 is just a pivotal person who i repeatedly lock into throughout my life he brings the knowledge the hustle the comedy the motivation the dominance everything you need to hear to push further in your path,positive
50 knows how to lead an interview and command respect in the room his aura and energy is just different mixed with a wealth of knowledgeintelligence all you have to do is sit back and listen with open ears ,positive
this is why the breakfast club is legendary at any given moment a super legend will pull up and do a great interview,positive
this made me respect 50 even more his business acumen is so on point i love that hes helping schools in houston he comes off as the bully of the block but hes ultimately giving people jewels and leaves it up to them to make jewelry this man is constantly learning the business and taking over kudos and blessings to him,positive
50 is one of the few who has truly studied the industry for years and is now reaping what he has sown every time he interviews he drops jewels  hate him or love him but you gotta respect him,positive
50 is just a pivotal person who i repeatedly lock into throughout my life he brings the knowledge the hustle the comedy the motivation the dominance everything you need to hear to push further in your path,positive
man to see dudes like 50 genuinely laughing and smiling like this and to know where they came from and how hiphop changed their lives is really amazing the rap game is a blessing to the black community and it makes me wonder how some of these dudes could make it and still wanna be in crime risking their lives and their freedom when they could be out here living their best lives like 50,positive
say what ever you want but boosie is the epitome of a southern raised black man he has real qualities and he stands on it no matter what it doesn’t matter if you white black brown don’t matter with this man respect him and he’s respectful back you don’t have to agree with everything the man says but most of what he says is the real deal facts or the hard perspectives that many people aren’t comfortable talking about been a huge fan of boosie through his whole career i wish nothing but great things for him as a louisiana native it gives us hope that one day that type of success can be achieved,positive
madd respect for boosie this man talks common sense and self respect need more like this man and many more men out here in this world,positive
hands down one of the best boosie interviews he’s always keep in it real real ,positive
these interviews are great with boosie they made me go back and listen to his music loved his songs now im a fan,positive
i died when boosie said im not finished ,negative
how can you not like this man he’s going to keep it 100 every time he opens his mouth,negative
boosie is so passionate about what he believes in and is very outspoken he stands on his beliefs i admire his truth and how he puts logic on hot topics you can disagree to agree but you must respect his opinion because we all have them keep that truth coming boosie badazz,positive
i really love this guy ain’t never listened to his music but i can listen to him talk forever i mean he’s ten toes down on everything no wavering boosie is the peoples champ for real,positive
boosie is one of the realest cant go around that this man stands up for what he believes in ,positive
one thing that this is proof of is that mankind was a lot smarter and a lot more advanced than we give ourselves credit for i’ve believe the pyramids were made by manpower and engineering my entire life they probably didn’t quarry the stones they probably made them and it’s very well possible to pull that stone if you but 100’s or even 1000’s if people to pull it i also believe they used larger animals like elephants to help pull them quicker plus mankind was very strong and not fat and lazy like now so yea you get a bunch strong people to pull it they can i’ve seen power lifter body builders pull big rigs by themself they probably had some kind of technique they made it be able to move and where they made the stones was probably close by,positive
ive already seen the ones in my country mexico now id love to see the ones in egypt,positive
how the great pyramids were built yeah im still wondering this show sure didnt explain how they were built,negative
i defer to geologist geology is a true science archeology not so much nobody can explain how they were quarried transported and built the fact that egyptologists not scientists btw stick their story of when they were built is outrageous,negative
i remember this this series was interesting,positive
“world governments lay in ruins major cities smolder from the attack and those who have managed to survive struggle with a sparse food supply” that’s a description of the present day lol,negative
if theyre much more advanced technologically than us theyre most likely highly intelligent also if they have the capability to get from wherever theyre from to here their ships are most likely gonna have shields or armor that can resist our weapons travel between the stars requires protection,positive
aliens are intelligent enough to see that our governments are doing a good enough job at destroying the world,negative
i believe that with few exceptions any aliens that are extremely advanced would be kind and beneficial to mankind and might only want to observe and not interfere with our development if they are that advanced they dont need anything we have or earth they would have the intelligence to produce it themselves,positive
i’m always wondering how those people immediately think we would need to fight back a species that doesn’t even showed itself yet for better or worse,negative
the most advanced aggressive alien species is less of a threat to humanity than the earthly powers in control,negative
of all the multiple universes and the infinity of it all why would we be a threat to any aliens or better yet why would aliens even notice our existence especially if we are as a planet near destruction anyway,negative
this still makes the aliens too primitive and human like more than likely theyd just turn everything off like a giant emp and use some sort of frequency that affects our nervous system knocking us out then they come down to collect what they want or to take over is it exciting full of action giving the humans a chance to take a stand no but its more efficient and something an advanced species would do,negative
its like netflix for history sign up to history hit the worlds best history documentary service and get 50 off using the code timeline,positive

himmlers death isn’t entirely accurate he was detained for a short time and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item and during his autopsy it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived some suspect that he was beaten to death historian and youtuber “mark felton” researched this very subject about himmler in a youtube series called “the death of himmler” i cannot recommend his videos enough his videos remind me of what the military channel once was before it became the american hero’s channel if anyone remembers that,negative
it is always amazing how quickly people forget the aftermath of a specific event good report thank you,positive
i read a book about the battle of berlin and it talked about how those foreign ss units fought to the bitter end since many had no countries to go back to because they have been captured by the allies,negative
goerings original message to hitler was very concilatory and respectfully asked if a transfer of power was neccessary unfortunately for goering the message fell into the hands of martin bormann who despised him bormann changed the tone of the message to make it look like goering was issuing and ultimatum,negative
what surprises me most with this video is how many people were aware of hitlers demise and whom tried to destroy his body i grew up continually surrounded with ppl expressing doubts that hitler had actually killed himself it seems pretty clear that he did,negative
the wahlter wenck story is pretty cool absolutely insane that he manged at that point in the war to successfully attack and get the people out and save their lives sabaton made a song about it hearts of iron,positive

as a vietnam veteran with ptsd i can honestly say you have your moments this is a mental illness but depending on what you experienced in a war it can bring back certain events ten years of therapy in 1999 denied you dont have ptsd but now va says chronic ptsd i grew it over the last 23 years i was awarded ptsd this month my grandson joined the army at age 31 he did not need to do that skilled in plumbing and heating making about 40 per hour with 1012 years of experience but my influence as a us army veteran of 13 years only 18x training,negative
a lot of what he said in this video is correct you asvab determines what mos or military occupational specialty you can go into i was us army 19861998 i like how there are movie references in the animation,positive
i have ptsd and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts it is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened you keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with ptsd arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation i guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts the idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in ptsd you still keep dwelling on it years later,negative
i can confirm that drill sergeants constantly curse at trainees the whole drill sergeants cant swear at people anymore myth is bogus,negative
as far as shoot to kill goes were trained to aim for center mass of the body this lessens the change of missing however its actually better to severely wound an enemy soldier than outright killing him the reason being that now others who could be fighting or otherwise engaged in some valuable task have to care for and transport the injured soldier thereby using up resources and personnel as cold as it sounds a dead soldier becomes a supply problem,negative
as a marine with 7 years of service i can say that hazing 100 exists and is an integral part of marine corps basic training full metal jacket was the most accurate representation but it’s more than that also you don’t shoot unless it’s to kill not to disarm not to scare but to kill and if you’re with anyone that’s afraid to do so you can’t trust them to have your back,negative
my great uncle served 2 tours in vietnam as a medical huey pilot he came back with ptsd and his episodes are usually panicking or scans the room he only got violent once when a burglar triggered him when he pulled a knife on my great aunt the guy is currently still recovering in the hospital 3 months later,negative
when i was drafted in 1964 my starting pay was 99 per month when i got married later that year my wifes allotment of 230 per month was more than twice my base pay and when i was injured in a role as support for a certain civilian agency violating the law in southeast asia i was called a liar and threatened with a court martial i am proud of my service to my country but being in the service ducks,negative

everything about egypt fascinates me im so interested in its history and want to know more and more,positive
one of the best explanations of the highs and lows of the power of egypt the incredible architecture and art the power plays and the growth of the egyptian empire very well done and very well presented history comes alive with enthusiastic experts talking us through the centuries very talented and professional presenter famous historians and keeps you interested and even excited it was long but i learned a lot i wanted to be an egyptologist as a child if i had seen this then i would have become one fascinating,positive
this like so many other documentaries just barely scratch the surface of the secrets these ancient times and civilizations keep i believe we will never truly fathom the depth of their engineering feats,negative
i never tire of learning egyptology well produced and sophisticated tv,positive
i love engineering an empire it shows a complete timeline of rulers from emperors to kings to pharaohs,positive
such great shows egypt aztecs the mayans i love the history channel,positive
its like netflix for history sign up to history hit the worlds best history documentary service and get 50 off using the code timeline,positive
i grew up in the shadow of cahokia and it has been extremely influential in my appreciation and reverence for all peoples in college we excavated a game processing camp many miles from cahokia and the enormity of the resources needed to feed their rapidly expanding population was an incredible story all on its own i appreciate how thoughtful and well made this documentary is and hope more will be coming in the near future,positive
there are a lot of unique aspects to this video that i really enjoyed the small sample of languages even the hunting reenactments native american cultures are so interesting and diverse they’re just endlessly fascinating i hope the native languages will always be preserved there’s always resistance by children especially teenagers to adopt the more conservative aspects of their parents’ culture i remember listening to a navajo radio station near window rock az and when the “required” traditional song was finished the young dj said “that’s enough of that bleep the tribe makes us play these” then put the latest rock back on this is universal not specific to any cultures kids around the world always want what’s new when they eventually have children of their own they’re glad they received the traditional culture and want to pass it on,positive
what an amazing story is being uncovered and told so many generations so many lives so many experiences we owe a great deal to those that came before us and should pass on the best of what we have learned to those who will follow we are all different and unique yet we share what is most important humanity,positive
what i always found interesting growing up in s louis is that the mississippi indian empire had its capital in what is cahokia il but that they buried their dead on the other side of the river in s louis so downtown s louis is built on top of a massive ancient native american cemetery,positive
i wish you guys included the myths and stories of the indigenous peoples of the western hemisphere theyre very interesting and similarly eerie to some of the stories of europe,positive

its tradition to watch this video every once in a while what a masterpiece,positive
summer in the uk the sun is a deadly lazer winter in the uk not anymore theres a blanket clouds,negative
honestly captain kidd just seems like a guy who desperately wanted to climb the social ladder but his failure as a privateer and the pressure from his crew made him an unwilling pirate,negative
i have always enjoyed reading about pirates this was very well done,positive
kidd avery teach jack bonnie reid roberts the greatest of pirates they may have done some awful things but something about their rebellion is inspiring and for better or worse their legacy is immortal,positive
if you like this type of stuff the show from a few years ago called black sails is the best pirate show ever and one of the best shows in general it has everything i would ever ask for in a pirate show its a legit 910 show if youre into the age of sails piracy and british naval expansionism type stuff with the americascaribbean of this time period its a must watch i already watched the series a second time since it ended its only 4 seasons but it was ended perfectly,positive
how disappointing captain kidd being one of only 4 pirates i could name had a very short and minor career compared to other pirates,negative
this has quickly become one of my favorite history channels thank you for the wide variety of high quality docs youre providing for free i have a curiositystream subscription and your channel has a better variety quality than most of the docs in their history subsection maybe ill have to check out history hit instead when i can afford it,positive
i love stuff involving ships and the ocean love learning about shipwrecks exploration voyages etc like a lot of events that happened in history pirates have been romanticized over time and as a result what weve perceived as how these people lived is not all true,positive
i absolutely love history i enjoyed this so much and have subbed,positive
i must say this was the best pirate documentary i have ever seen well done sir well done,positive
i had just been wanting to watch a documentary about pirates what luck well done,positive

nothing beats the 4 part mini series by pbs on napoleon,positive
people either love him or hate him i see a man who was a great opportunist and understood how the world works tell me how he is worst than the institutions run today by men but hide from their bunkers he fought with his men gave epic speeches and rewarded his staff and troops greatly he gave men a reason to live even if self motivated when i listen to people british who hate him they sound envious yes he plunder the church but didn’t kill any clergyman— which is uncommon in war historians hide behind the “but the crown was corrupt so the revolution followed” no bro power wealth will always be corrupt these people wanted violence for free healthcare take a hike napoleon was no saint but i rather my country be an empire lead by a patriot than some international court,negative

putting up the name cards whenever you mention or remention people or say ‘he’ is an underrated genius move it’s so easy to keep track thanks to it wish other documentaries would do that,positive
the fact that you have singlehandedly researched recorded edited and produced this documentary is astounding i happen to know the amount of work thats involved in something like that usually its a team of a handful or even tens of people,positive
another outstanding production this is the sort of thing that should be promoted on youtube not the rubbish that always seems to get all the views what you accomplish virtually singlehandedly is astounding putting to shame projects with large crews and budgets take a long vacation youve more than earned one for the massive effort this took,positive
i really appreciate these documentaries i never had the money for college so i feel like i’m actually still learning something when i watch them,positive
the sumerians were beautiful artisans i’ve seen queen puabi’s artifacts at an exhibit in the penn museum in philadelphia pennsylvania and they really stuck with me before you said puabi’s name i already felt the footage you were showing looked familiar that doesn’t happen to me too often with historical societies and i go to a lot of anthropological museums really a testament to how strong of an impression seeing their crafts will leave on you i really recommend anyone who is able to go visit the penn museum the exhibit on queen puabi and her people is pretty extensive the jewelry especially is so ornate and finely smithed it’s amazing to think how long ago people were already incredibly skilled in making beautiful things,positive
hey pete we really appreciate the amazing writing and hard work you put into these epic videos thank you for all of the great stuff to watch,positive
an excellent and well narrated documentary not detailed enough to confuse the average person yet broader in interpretation than far too many other works a very good balance ,positive
this was amazing sumer has always been a topic of study for me and has held my interest for years because of the people of sumer and the akkadians i have a deeper understanding of biblical text from the legend of gilgamesh to ishtar a people rich in an ancient history predating eqypt brilliant work on this my friend thx again,positive

excellent explanations of earth’s past where we are now new rock type made of plastic says it all for modern human life,positive
this is one of the most interesting documentaries i have ever viewed also one the most frightening i like the explanations of the past extinctions when not all the facts are not in it is really made clear with some educated guesses,positive
…why wasn’t the great oxidation event included on this list the worst extinction event that killed off close to all prior anaerobic microscopic forms of life,negative
at the beginning they mention the oceans stagnating but i find that troubling with the effects of the moon plate tectonics wouldn’t they have had a more significant impact on the earth i get confused when our land mass was a combined continent but there’s no mention of that as a factor in these earlier extinctions or are we meant to know that ourselves also there would’ve been more frequent meteor impacts at that time too although they’d be harder to prove but i wouldn’t know i’m certainly no expert on the subject i just rely on logic,negative
very interesting well done,positive
yeah we are most definitely going to inevitably be our own downfall we may have the tools and technology to weather some disasters but we depend so much on the infrastructures we have set up to the point where most people probably wouldnt know what to do without wifi and cellular data let alone weather catastrophic effects on our food sources and supply chains,negative
“he attempted to take british somaliland which went pretty well he then attempted to take egypt which went less well then he attempted to take greece which went really badly churchill began to describe italy as europe’s soft underbelly”,negative
the greek civil war is still an incredibly taboo topic in modern greek society so much unnecessary death atrocities and war crimes committed by both sides neither left nor right wingers really want to talk about it but the unmended scar it has left to the greek people till this day is undeniable most greeks today have or might have had a relative or family friends that will have horror stories to tell because of this war,negative
im a greek and this stuff isnt even taught in school even though it affected the rest of our history in the 20th century thank you very much for your efforts,positive
the truman doctrine was part of a speech written to garner american support for fighting communist forces in greece there was worry that there would be minimal support for fighting in greece hence why the speech was so strong but inevitably it worked a lot better than anyone had expected,positive

536 ad is the estimated timeframe that the krakatoa volcano experienced an extremely massive eruption that caused a column of smoke ash and debris 13 miles high so much material was ejected into the atmosphere that it shrouded the earth causing temperature drops and ensuing human suffering krakatoa would erupt massively again around 1200 and the most recent climatechanging eruption was in the 1880s the 1880s eruption was estimated to be equivalent to 160 megatons the tsar bomba was a measly 57 megatons in comparison,negative

the sheer fact i’m alive is amazing my bloodline manage to make it through some of the worst times in human history think of how many bloodlines that made it through the hundreds of centuries that will end today do to a car crash or overdose or suicide appreciate being alive work hard to make ever day matter these people in 536 worked hard to make sure you’d be here today,positive
you know i find this fact somewhat reassuring if we can survive a year like that then perhaps the human race is more resilient that we think,positive

i cant imagine the time spent researching this and writing the script your narration is wonderfully clear and concise nevermind the filming and editing watching it was a very enjoyable learning experience i look forward to part two,positive
absolutely brilliant presentation that is not said lightly for i am a college professor of archeology ancient history though of a different period of time of a region far far away from the british isles if in your notes you have some information concerning the norse invasion of nw scotland by coll call and his flotilla it would be interesting a very large number of the present population of scotland trace their heritage to the coll and campbell cohorts families your facts are spot on and your presentation is nothing short of spectacular thank you very much,positive

“ you will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on” will now be my favorite quote it’s sad how often ppl prove benjamin franklins words true he would probably be very disappointed with the ignorance and misinformation we’re surrounded by,negative
just as a point of order he didnt accidentally harm or kill millions of people he and others knew the consequences of their actions but was prepared for others to py the ultimate price for his pieces of silver greed is and will continue to be the downfall of mankind,negative
ironic isnt it that in the long race a scientist who worked to create the nuclear bombs went to save humanity and the other working for the betterment of society would actually end up poisoning it,negative
very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity but even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period most paints contained extremely high levels of lead many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes most pencils had a high lead concentration hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil house roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water i could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile solder usually 6040 lead tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment so you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels to blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view,negative

thank you i love unexplained mysteries and i love your channel,positive
i love a good mystery as much as any1 but it really really annoys me that a lot of ppl always jump the most far out explanation however improbable or even impossible such as aliens even when there are numerous possible explanations that are both simple and commonplace but then those are the same ppl who will disregard any fact that doesnt fit their tinfoil hat theory and cherrypick usable facts they twist and change to fit them or just plain invent facts sorry if im pissing off all the conspiracy buffs but when i hear hoofbeats my first thought isnt zebras or even worse aliens,negative

if you want to know the truth about these artifacts and how awesome the ancient israelites came to the usa before the time of christ read the four book series by stephen m collins about the lost tribes of israel he spent over 10 years researching this issue and had access to an ancient private library they are worth reading,positive
i love the work you do and these show make me imagine what we don’t know could be true,positive
scott thank you for presenting information that compels people to think and challenge the status quo even though its impossible to prove any of the information you have to step back and think and consider that he may be on to something here,positive
scott im becoming a skeptic of your show its interesting but not much gets solved and some of it is pretty far fetched you didnt even convince the guy at the lab on this one you do need skeptics on your show just to give a counter argument instead of people who just agree there could be logical reasons that your show is not presenting that may counter what you show,negative
scott you make good entertaining shows that titillate the imagination but you are anything but objective and are always seeking the grandiose explanation you know this is seldom the case templars lost tribes bigfoot cmon dude,negative
i love your videos i think you would be intrigued to hear or perhaps you are already aware that there is an ancient record that was unearthed in the 1820s in palmyra new york that was inscribed in reformed egyptian by ancient israelites they crossed over the seas from jerusalem around 600 bc and landed on what they described to be a narrow neck of land most likely in panama they left their records behind for us and their records spoke of jesus christ visiting them after his resurrection they multiplied their seed and spread north and south and fought many battles over the north and south american continents which were considered their new promised land thus the signs of christ written with hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate there is another record which has been discovered in panama much like the one discovered in palmyra new york it is a gold set of plates with ancient egyptian and hebrew origins as well perhaps you could examin the panama gold plates to see if they are authentic,positive

i was honestly terrified of abomination in hulk ultimate destruction as a kid i hope they dont ruin him,negative
ive always loved his design since i first discovered him hes just stuck out and now i know he can breathe underwater glad the movies gave him his iconic gills,positive
i really dig the origin they gave him in the 2008 film because the military gave him something before he went powerhungry and took the risk of adding hulks blood to the mix that way the abomination thing actually makes more sense,positive
rick jones becoming abomination is also probably a call back to him being abomb who was just a blue abomination with more spikes,negative
i love all these stories but somehow its always the 21 sikhs that make me tear up every time i think its because the last guy died so bravely and so horribly but showed no fear and went out singing the battle hymn of his people what a punch in the feels,positive

ive never watched the movie but the book 12 years a slave was so descript and disturbing although there were times i had to put the book down i really like how it brought much more light to the tortures and horrendous practices performed by the yt man and the yt woman textbooks in high school never went into the details of physical and mental punishments all i was ever taught about was whippings beatings and a little about the rapings but there was so much more that only an inhumane brute could think of doing solomon northup described them a lot as demoniac being possessed with an evil spirit and soulless seedofesau,negative

im beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity theres place of brashness boldness creativity fear light touch nimbleness anger bluffs it is a beautiful game rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics it has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one how many more things are possible in a game how far ahead can pieces support each other how deep and farseeing ideas can be and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions,positive
holy guacamole that was amazing easily one of the best documentaries ive ever seen please do more about chrss history its what the chess community needs to realize this game isnt just magnus and supercomputers finding the best moves but actual styles of play and players that for so long determined the game,positive
chess clock brief history would be good to have been included in this documentary how would one classify classical chess against rapid chess without clock nevertheless this is such a good film finally a chess film that has filled the void,positive

i live in volgogradstalingrad all the veterans i saw said that this battle was a real hell when the asphalt is repaired or the pipeline is replaced the remains of soldiers are still found in the ground and 70 years have passed,negative
the germans really did hand the soviets a beachhead fortress in this city with all the bombed rubble it only became more of a nightmare to advance into,negative
a couple of my distant german family members were at stalingrad and are still there as far as i know none of the family know when or where they died exactly but there are oak trees planted on the family land as a memorial i only learnt this while looking through family history trying to learn more about my roots they were barely in their 20s conscripted and sent to fight im now older than they were and i couldnt imagine going through that sort of living hell i understand they were on the wrong side and i absolutely respect the russians for defending their homeland but whenever i hear the word stalingrad it makes me think of those guys war is a waste so much potential in humanity just thrown away at the whims of the people in power,negative
thank you for mentioning the real reason behind the 227 order so many people think it was just a cruel note allowing kgb monsters to shoot soldier at whim but please do stop addressing soviets as russians there were soldiers of many nations in the red army and they do not deserve to be forgotten,negative
my grandfather fought on the german side from the beginning to the bitter end of this battle then spent months working inside a gulag as a miner finally escaping few days before his unit was signed for execution he never wanted to talk much about the war only few stories about his comrades and struggle for survival i guess he felt ashamed for all the suffering nazis brought to this world i remember the day i asked him about it he didnt say anything my grandmother took me on a side and told me to never ask him about a stalingrad,negative
any entertainment channel you watch will never tell you any of the real bad stuff they are doing they will give you some small nuggets of truth but never tell you whats really going on,negative
the information we get through public domain is channelized and censored so that people should never know about them it is just laughable to allow a tv show to sell all your secrets so whatever they share you cannot really tell whether it is the whole truth or just an explanation to keep you away from too much of thinking i appreciate the concept of the show and it is binge worthy that is for sure but it cannot be honest,negative
i remember reading an article about an apartment building that kept making people sick and they suspected mold but couldnt find any it turned out that the air conditioning ducts were making a high pitch frequency sound that was making people sick,negative
i guess im a true conspiracy theorist because i dont think anyone that would actually know if any of these things existed would tell the truth and those that dont know for sure are only expressing an opinion,negative

though reminding ourselves of the horrific times in the past might console us to get through this pandemic you cant deny that the definition of catastrophic is different for everyone the inequalities are huge the rosy picture you showed is probably in developed nations people have lost jobs lives dignity even democracies each time period has its own set of limitations and challenges ours is different,negative
the fact that we enjoy watching these historical videos and also understand them better than at school is amazing,positive
everyones understandind of the situation is relative to their own subjective experience it is unfair to make comparisons bewtween the past and the present without taking into account all the different variables which is practically impossible its like electricity going out and you saying you think thats bad ackchually humans lived without electricity for thousands of yeears of course thats a ridiculous statement because humans in the past were not nearly as dependent on electricity as we are now and even though it may not have been important to them to us no electricity for just a month could mean the dissolution of the world as we know it so please dont make ignorant comparisons between the present and the past as if things were indeed that simple,negative

this is a little less crazy then some other people but me and one of my closest friends met in the 9th grade one weekend we both were going to our grandparents houses and we found out that way that we were only a half a street away from each other another crazy aspect was that my mother and her father had both grown up in those houses and had attended the same elementary middle and high school exactly 10 years apart he had also seen my mothers house being built kind of crazy,positive

my grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in dongguan which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years in the guangdong province her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind she says that before her farm was confiscated by the ccp her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth but they really didnt have a choice in the matter there would always be distant relatives and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go had no money and were starving my grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide at some point she housed and fed more than 1520 of them for many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to hong kong which was free from the troubles of china at the time many had heard of the prosperity that the british colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter hong kong when the government at the time announced they were issuing id cards for citizenship albeit his heart still belongs to china as the indoctrination that generation was subject to to them was really profound he would often complain to his children why do all of you not love china and they would retort if you love china so much what are you doing in hong kong to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer i asked my grandmother once do you think mao zedong is good and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation yes yes hes wonderful and started blurting out the first few phrases of the chinese national anthem in song i guess its why that generation is called the lost generation,negative
i love how honest you guys are very brave to point this history out you guys really are the best,positive

your take on the habsburgs is wildly inaccurate they didnt rule over the holy roman empire they reigned due to the hundreds of independent principalities marquisates archbishoprics free cities and electors not even the emperor charles v could break this political logjam the later empire was enlightened by current european standards and im not saying this because im a fan of theirs im not but lets be accurate shall we,negative

the one thing i hate about these shows and the people in them is that they state their own hypothesis or that of others but state them as fact not as what they are hypothesis opinion or at most very well educated guesses the only way to claim those cave paintings are one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt would be to talk to the actual creators of the images shame on them for lying,negative

the maritime disaster that was the sinking of the titanic in 1912 lives on in memory still in the 21st century how remarkable is that really one of the startling facts for me is that it sank in just under three hours with a loss of 1500 people it must have been terrifying especially as it happened in the dark one of the most eerie things ive ever watched is when scientists finally found the wreck a great distance from where they thought it would be they were in a mini sub and the bulk of the ship just loomed out of the darkness it was truly weird i dont like deep water in fact terra firma for me thank you great video neil see you tomorrow,negative

watched this tonight as part of an adult education course and wante to say that this video perfectly articulates why i want to go back to education i also feel the majority of the points can be applied to all types of great art whether it be it a beautiful painting a song a movie even a comic sandman or a tv show the wire in answer to a few of the comments below the video was specifically speaking about what literature is for therefore that is the only subjectmedium it should analyse but i agree that any great art can teach us what it means to be human,positive

nevertheless life is pleasant life is tolerable tuesday follows monday then comes wednesday the mind grows rings the identity becomes robust pain is absorbed in growth opening and shutting shutting and opening with increasing hum and sturdiness the haste and fever of youth are drawn into service until the whole being seems to expand in and out like the mainspring of a clock how fast the stream flows from january to december we are swept on by the torrent of things grown so familiar that they cast no shadow we float we float … — virginia woolf the waves,positive

one of my favorite female writers what a woman my will to study every day more and more is definitely fruit of her legacy,positive
its really amazing  want on topic like how to read critically close reading or how to read the text effectively,positive
the first minute of the video is almost the same explanation that was given to us by our professor in literature when i was in college the rest of it is an expansion of what i already know and at some point i came to realize that there are more things that i havent stumbled upon before in the introduction of lit thanks a lot and i hope you produce more content for both language and literature subjects,positive
great youve regarded the subject from multiple different angles which help us get acquainted with the ins and outs of the topic but there are intrinsic and extrinsic factors to be taken for granted to decide which texts are literature,positive
if you enjoyed the video please let us know by hitting the like button asking a question or sharing your thoughts on these definitions of literature in the comments section thanks for watching everybody,positive
your videos are really what makes things interesting and understandable can we expect one on literary periods pls,positive
i so appreciated this video because as a literary multigenre novelist ive been feeling like the odd man out ive been told that my work will be appreciated after im dead but that gives me little comfort however its good to know that there really is no consensus on what constitutes literature good or otherwise subscribed,positive

i cannot imagine any television networks making these sort of programs these days it is rather depressing because 1980s is rather recent for some of us at that time we were worried about dumbing down of culture yet there were still plenty of high brow culture covered by main stream media in retrospect 1980s may have been the last era in which high culture would have any part to play in television,negative
great conversation thank you,positive
a lovely conversation ,positive
does anyone have a lovehate relationship with analyzing literature like when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion but when i try to find a meaning of something it always turns out to be wrong even though there’s technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly it just doesn’t make sense to me when i would get a 75 on a analysis paper just because the teacher didn’t seeanalyze what i wrote about a certain text,negative
this is why i pretty much lost a significant focus on writing and critical analysis much of the following is due to bad memory but everything i would say and write as my own point of view on the understanding of a characters situation i would get it wrong maybe i needed to grow up from such a sheltered environment and know first hand what the characters in the novels essays were going through i was only a kid,negative
thank you sososososo much for this video my school is crap and doesnt teach us these things but i want to be able to analyze books and ive sort of been trying to but videos like these are always a good reminder thank you,positive
i disagree i have never been able to find the deeper meaning in literature however i have always enjoyed when people discuss the symbolism and meaning behind parts of books that i took at face value videos like this give me another way to think about what i am reading and they help me find the deeper meanings of a text when i read it,positive
stuff is always so open to interpretation i ragequit before a few chapters trying to analyze literature it takes all the joy of reading out of me,negative
some great ideas this is why i love reading and literature the human condition is so complex,positive
you make it sound so simple definitely using these ideas in my classroom,positive
lovely visuals and amazing lesson great way to understand storytelling,positive
acknowledging the insight and complexity of finding small and complex clues in a literary work seems to be a way to use in any work this is because not only foreign literary works in this way but also korean works are need to show complexity and insight to understand from now on when i see these works i will read them with a sense of complexity and insight,positive
this was a great introduction to kafka thank you,positive
the trial was the most relatable novel i’ve ever read that feeling that the world is just against you and you don’t know why but yet you feel like you deserve it because you couldn’t live up to the standard expectations,positive
the narrator has a very good pronunciation of german wordsnames,positive
this video doesnt even mention his humor which is abundant alongside the tragedy and darkness,negative
the saddest of us are usually cursed to see the happiness that isnt there,negative
the task of literature is to reconnect us with feelings that might otherwise be unbearable to study but which desperately need our attention so intense damn,negative
if only literature lessons at school were so interesting,positive
i cried so much kafka is filled with deepest most harmful dark inner feelings within us all i wish his father read his letter though,negative

you’re the kind of person that everyone wants as their best friend,positive
i knew dorian gray would be on this list this is the book that made me realize classics could be engrossing and accessible to people today,positive
so many good recommendations if i could add a few id put •wuthering heights by emily brontë • rebecca by daphne du maurier • the secret garden by frances hodgson burnett another childrens classic yay • steppenwolf by herman hesse the structure can be a bit weird at first but when the story fully kicks in youre in for a ride lmao • the martian chronicles or fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury for those who enjoy scifi • pedro páramo by juan rulfo a piece of classical mexican literature said to be the inspiration for one hundred years of solitude,positive
perfume story of a murderer is one of the books that got me excited about reading in general which is both a blessing and a curse because i have yet to read a book as good as it since,positive
you should definitely make videos on how you annotate your books and write your essays ,positive
the writing in the picture of dorian gray is so unique i remember reading the first couple of chapters and literally smelling roses and and linen it felt beautiful without luscious prose somehow,positive
im actually in an english major and english is not my first language its spanish and yes reading classics is really overwhelming especially if its not your first language at least for me what it helped me was start with short stories or poems so you can go slow with unknown words also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine,positive
every time i watch your videos about philosophy literature psychology and sociology i am left with one very unsatisfying thought there are so many books in the world that i want to read and dont feel like i will ever have the time to though im only in my early 20s,negative
school of life has made my insight in philosophy so much wider,positive
anna karenina and the death of ivan ilyich are among the best books ive ever read if you do read tolstoy make sure to go with the pevear and volokhonsky translations they allow you to get the most from his works,positive
his life is so wholesome and laddish at the same time from being a drunk gambling layabout pestering gypsy women then getting bored and becoming an officer to penning literary masterpieces about inner kindness and understanding then just walking out on your family and dying of pneumonia absolute madman,negative
my all time favorite writer an entire school of life episode could be dedicated to tolstoys short stories strider god sees the truth but waits what men live by master and man the wood felling sevastopol ive read all those stories 50 times and hope to read them 50 more james joyce once said that tolstoys how much land does a man need is the greatest short story ever written,positive

i’m happy that you said that our degrees should be seen as hobbies because not everything has to be something career driven and that’s something that’s moved me back into my love for english and writing and i’m so thankful 3,positive
not gonna lie your tiktoks and videos reignited my love for literature so much more than i already did the way you talk about it really comes through it made me remember why i love literature so much in the first place,positive
you literally exude elegance i adore you and your energy,positive
i love literature ive loved it for as long as i can remember however i grew up dirt poor and seeing the way my parents who both worked day and night struggled to provide for us and meet ends meet gives me a pretty innate fear of falling into poverty as an adult i want to provide for my parents and i want to be able to provide abundously for a kid if i had one i am lucky enough to have received grants for college and as much as ait hurts i dont intend to waste it on a major like english thats kinda just how it is wish the world was different not everybody has that luxury,positive
this video arrived at the most opportune moment i started off college im currently a sophomore with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture before starting college i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study even most of my cousins have studied something stem science tech engineering and math related while i did ok in my first semesters i felt really depressed and suffocated my mental health was at its lowest it was a terrible time for me i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse a week ago i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors from biochem to english let me tell you i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major,negative
i majored in biology with minors in chemistry and philosophy always loved reading and sometimes i wish i majored in english i want to start writing soon but i just need to find the time outside of my scientific career lol like you i’ve always seen myself as a bibliophile but was frequently discouraged from studying the arts i kept reading and i now have a small personal library i love the feeling of just thinking and getting lost in a book dissecting the words and the scenes they provoke in my mind you brought up some good points and relatable experiences thank you,positive
i’ve always had a passion for reading and writing since i was little my older cousin who helped me fuel it would always tell me that i’d make an amazing author i don’t know if i have the talent tbh but it’s something i’ve dreamed of doing forver but i’m torn between what i wanna do right now it kinda sucks and finally i love you too dakota,positive
as an artistwriter myself it has always been a hobby of mine and now i want to turn it into a fulltime passionjob but i am currently in college with my psychology degree because being an empath is also comes natural to me and i want to help people so i have a lot planned for the future and hopefully i’ll have a work published in less than a year and a half,positive
this genuinely assisted me in attempting to find my passion in itself thank you,positive
this is for those who arent in a very privileged situation and want to take literature and writing i am a third year college student studying creative writing in a country that gives importance to stem courses and careers my family is not at all financially stable and yet im studying in one of the most prestigious schools in the country i have often felt guilty about this choice of mine because i know my parents do not 100 understand my choice yet they have to pay for my tuition but luckily for me my parents support me 100 i feel this stress to quickly find a job after college and our country doesnt have a lot of opportunities for writers too but i know this is the path i want to take o want to work with books so i just try my best to push down the feelings of fear because i know that if i stay in this path and do my absolute best to find the perfect career i would be happy for myself and my family to those in a similar position as me my word of advice is to just follow what you think is right for you follow what will make you happy because it is you who will be living with that decision 3 i dont regret my choice,negative
jane austen also teaches us not to be to tough on introverts they turn out to be her most worthy characters,positive
these videos have opened my eyes to the beauty of philosophy and literature its such a comforting feeling to learn that the questions and often sad thoughts in my head have been thought of and so thoroughly worked on by these great men and women in the past in the past two weeks since ive started to watch these videos i have seriously reconsidered many topics and views i have on life its a shame american core curriculum doesnt require the teaching of philosophy and reasoning if more people learned and discussed these issues it could make our societies and lives so much more fulfilling,positive
kudos to the animators of all the episodes i dont think they get nearly enough appreciation,positive
yes her novels make us laugh dont forget to emphasize how witty and funny austen is,positive
whats even more crazy is that jane austen wasnt formally recognized as a great writer until the 1920s during her life people did not largely read her work and it wasnt until many decades later when a harvard scholar wrote a seminal paper on her work did she finally get attention,negative
j austen pride and prejudice is the first novel i read when i learned english i still found it difficult but beautiful as i improved i was mesmerized at her writing how well she could work on the carachters thank you for making a video of her life she was amazing writer,positive
as a writer shes my inspiration and im not a professional writer but i do love writing,positive
school of life is one of the most humanistic channel on youtube,positive
i could have listened to more than an hour on this subject alone victorian literature is an enormously broad topic with writers as diverse as emily bronte and joseph conrad id love to see you do a more expanded version,positive
excellent video i appreciate all your researchthe victorian era is very fascinating to me i especially like the mystery or adventure books of the era my favorite are doyle stevenson verne melville wilkie collins and kipling though not his more imperialist stuff does anyone have any more classic victorian adventure authors or stories i should try out,positive
i know this video is about literature but i cannot stop admiring the artwork ,positive
thank you for a great introduction to victorian literature i am especially impressed by how youve also highlighted other aspects of victorian culture especially its art,positive

i was admiring your writing skills the whole time everything just flowed so naturally i would kill to be able to write like that thank you so much,positive
super helpful i loved the way you presented the information it kept me interested the whole way through,positive
really fascinating the british empire having a billion inhabitants in the 1800s thats getting awfully close to modern demographics though with the important difference being that modern population numbers rose naturally and are actually maintainable,positive
thank you for citing your sources wonderful work,positive
thank you for this nicely done video,positive
teachers should show this to students everywhere this channel is a treasure,positive
i dont think that dickens shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional spiritual and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood while he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art quite an achievement he wasnt able to heal emotionally its usually easier to deal with such things in abstract intellectual and artistic ways he was in many ways driven by his demons and that can surprisingly take you very far in life but it doesnt make you a better person in fact the success may militate against real change,negative
im reading a charles dickens book for the first time and watching this video was really impressive the strategy he adopted seems very powerful maybe we need more of this general awareness and less ready solutions at some level,positive
dickenss genius was in bringing characters and physical objects to life he was not being seductive he was making us relive his experience and making people and places come to life no one will ever forget miss havishams wedding cake the character of bill sykes or mr micawber once you encounter the scenes and objects and characters of his novels you never forget them,positive
it really made me sad that this person was so great and dedicated in his work but at the same time at the expense of terrible relations with his wife and 10 children…it’s just so freaking sad you can never have it all can you,negative
this was an amazing video i really appreciate what youre doing here,positive

a tip from a once homeschooled college student who read a lot of classics read the annotated versions read the ones with context talk to people that are nerds about the historical context of the book it makes it so much more fun to know why certain weird things happen in old books,positive
as a beginner to classics myself i would absolutely recommend the picture of dorian gray to just about anyone it’s short quotable but also uses such accessible language,positive
the metamorphosis by kafka is super short easily digestible and laugh out loud funny in an absurdist sense 1010 would recommend,positive
i feel like pride and prejudice by jane austen was the perfect introduction to classics for me because i was so familiar with the plot that the language wasn’t insanely difficult,positive
really needed this because i have a weird relationship with classics i haven’t even started frankenstein for the book club because i’m genuinely scared lol,negative
the first classic i read was picture of dorian gray a while ago since then i have fallen in love with so many classics such as 1984 wuthering heights pride prejudice great gatsby etc cant wait to read some of these recs edit after some recommendations in my reply i read crime and punishment by dostoyevsky and loved it it’s soo good it’s a lot to take in but regardless amazing book,positive
i started reading again this year i was probably only reading 23 books a year for several years straight for a literature course i had to read persuasion by jane austen i fell in love with it and finished it in a day its also very short compared to her other novels it kickstarted my reading again and ive read 20 books so far this year not a crazy number compared to others however thats a huge leap from only 2 books a year,positive

ever heard the line he knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it that kinda applies here i never analyze a book or film on the first go it takes away the magic,negative
i really liked what you said around 325 about analysis being in retrospect recently i read the iliad a book that i had given up once before and which i knew near to nothing about i skipped the introduction which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it i was initially constrained by the idea that it was a difficult book but over time with some paced reading i found myself really curious about what would happen next i knew of course that i was doing a light reading of an overly analyzed book and that i would miss a lot of detail but i still enjoyed it and after finishing it i went back to read the introduction and found it incredible since it made me think critically about things i had read or notice stuff i missed as a bonus it also gave me desire to read it again youve earned a new subscriber from portugal looking forward to more videos,positive
you are so right the first reading is to get the idea and enjoy the book but if you stop there you never know what the book is really about not unless its a drugstore romance of course i fell absolutely in love with prousts writing luckily i can read french and reread my favorite passages in their original language thats when all the light bulbs went on i didnt realize it had as many plays on words in it he has so many clues to the theme that you dont see in english you just have to read things until you get them and like you i would say that three readings is just about right thanks for another great video,positive
i needed to hear this as im about to tackle some of thomas pynchons books please id love if you posted videos more regularly your content is amazing also could you maybe do a video talking about your experience reading in other languages because it can be frustrating to be facing a lot of unknown words and having to stop the rhythm of your reading i bet you have a lot of things to say about the subject thanks,positive
first of all i want to say that i am genuinely in love with your essays second i want to say that everything you say resonates in me in one way that i never experimented before maybe this channel is what i was looking for and thirdly thirdly i want to say that i will stop commenting right now and start to watch the video hahah,positive
these are really nice clips even though i doubt im really your target demographic having spent the last thirty years working full time in bookstores i was particularly taken with your take sorry on proust i had a very similar experience with thomas manns the magic mountain it took me three or four goes to get through it first time round but every time i started from the beginning again i was finding new stuff in it i hadnt noticed before and in the end taught myself enough german to be able to tackle it in the original which was hugely worthwhile and i still go back to it regularly proust is also great but there are large chunks of it i found really physically stifling and claustrophobic but if you read anything about his life story that makes perfect sense,positive
this narrator has the most calming and lovely voice,positive
“those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities” ― voltaire,negative
this series is spectacular ive never seen any catalouge of the intellectual history of mankind that even approaches the depth of meaning and scholarship youre building here im blown away and deeply grateful,positive
thanks school of life now i need to read some voltaire he is a very interesting man but his ideals are even more interesting so much mentioned in this video can be applied to the present day and even more can be applied to the human mind gotta love some history and philosophy every once in a while,positive
hey im really impressed by your french pronounciation even in other videos your foreign languages sound flawless could you make a video about yourself like who you are what do you do and so on,positive
thank you school of life for finally doing voltaire he was so witty and his views on many topics are admirable please do thomas paine next also other great thinkers you can possibly do next are david hume thomas jefferson and gottfried leibniz it would also be so cool if you did science as well along with philosophy and literature anyway your channel is great and i think your doing a fantastic job for culture im glad ive been a subscriber for this long and hope you get many more also i live in england and i might come visit your shop in london,positive

none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free,negative

i read “1984” and “animal farm” great books,positive
sophisticated entertainment and empty headed news reports all wrapped up in a constant reference to freedom sounds like america,negative
i couldnt have more love for this essayist and for this author who woke me up for good when i was just a kid in junior high i share his devotion to language and the free and organic use of it and of the wisdom of the ordinary people all over the world,positive
admittedly silly to subject milton and shakespeare to a kind of competition but this is well worth your time and effort the benefit of having talented professional actors reading the small bits of their works takes this endeavor far beyond the typical classroom experience truly enjoyable and enlightening,positive
the two scholars are amazing and the actors are sublime ive never felt so happy in my life yet so jealous of those in that conference room ive been clapping and cheering and crying all at once wow thank you,positive
very interesting discussion and amazing actingreading thank you for posting this,positive
as a dramatist shakespeare makes humans into important huge things milton seems to be making important huge things have a human personification it truly is comparing apples to oranges both are preeminent english lit masters and are distinguished in their own right enjoyable and enriching experience,positive
thank you intelligence squared for compiling the most brilliant instructive debate i have ever had the pleasure to view the entire show enhanced by the highly talented actors who played bit parts written by both of the 2 literary giants under discussion tonights show will become one of my lifes unforgettable experiences,positive
this was a lovely event worth it for the acting alone especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of eves awakening i do think the debate was played too much on shakespeares terms and turf in part because prof smith politely allowed it to stay there some thoughts biographical silence favours shakespeare about whom we know relatively little than milton whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss weakness aspiration perseverance hatred and love this was hardly raised so too historical context shakespeare comes clearly out of an elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like marlowe and codeveloped by writers like jonson milton obliterates the norms of mid17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism drama favours interiority and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness milton and most literary history would not have thought it so though the actors brilliantly depicted ms dramatic imagination in paradise lost his goal unlike shakespeares was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind but to go beyond them his theme is not finally the human but the humaninthecosmos in short we judged here whether milton was better according to the criteria of shakespeare shakespeare will win that battle with anyone milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether youre asking the right questions in the first place,positive
harriet walter embodies so perfectly lady macbeth that its shocking at sight bravo,positive
imagine the rsc with all its talented actors producing an audiobook recordingdramatisation of paradise lost oh bliss,positive
lady macbeth was stunning absolutely stunning her acting was on another level that’s passion for the work on an almost transcendental level she became that character man goosebumps,positive
id just like to point out that odysseus sleeping around was necessary for his survival if a powerful goddess like circe or calypso wants to have sex with you you dont have much choice if you reject them it could spell doom for you or your loved ones horny gods punishing mortals for denying them sex is a recurring theme throughout classical mythology,negative
the odyssey is homer unwriting the iliad when odysseus raids cheats and behaves generally like a iliadic hero he is at his weakest and at the beginning of his odyssey by the end he refuses to cheat on his wife with the incredible fantastic nausica he shows almost inhuman patience and selfcontrol in the face of the suitors abuse and he choses nostos over kleos the choice achilles couldnt stand to make whats more achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the iliad when odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead by saying that it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead and he doesnt lie to everyone he knows his cretan narratives are really important nonviolent defenses against a situation similar to agamemnon and clytemnestra,negative
please dont ever stop making literature videos because we dont have english literature in high school in where i live and i want to study it so bad even if my english is really not good,negative
i always loved the odyssey both in high school english and the movie to me it was one of the ultimate journey epics like lotr its just a very very long journey with a penultimate goal of returning home but with fun little adventures and trials along the way,positive
so even odysseus who is wise enough to be praised by athena for his wisdom loses himself in war does that say something about our attraction to war,negative
odysseus is literally made calypsos stud forced to have hot divine sex every day for seven years calypso asking him every day to live as an immortal with her odysseus still wants to go back to ithaca and penelope he goes to the water and cries every day looking out towards ithaca odysseus devotion to his wife and people is superhuman thats why hes the hero some nice piece of information i found on the web,positive
for an interesting read some people may want to check out the penelopiad by margaret atwood its a novel that was later turned into a play and tells the story of penelope in ithaca while odysseus was gone its an interesting contemporary view of a classical text,positive
i love that quote about literature being forced critical thinking that cannot be googled i hope this is where the world is going soon into a place of books and curious reading rather than simply googling and having things fed to you,positive
thank you so much for this im finally following my heart and transferring to a major in english literature coming from a biology major at times i get anxiety about it wondering how what i am learning will be useful aside from the fact that i love it this is just what i needed to hear,positive

i wish you could be my teacher ,positive

one hundred years of solitude truly is one of the best books ive read so far in 50 years of reading experience reminds me to read it again sometime in the near future,positive
pedro páramo by the mexican writer juan rulfo is one of the masterpieces of latin american literature it is considered the novel that inaugurated the literary subgenre of magical realism in latin america juan rulfos work finally gave me the path i was looking for to continue with my books” colombian nobel laureate gabriel garcía márquez confessed in an interview,positive
i read a magical realism text for the first time in a magazine it told the story of three dragons who were adopted by a couple they raised them as if they were human the way the author narrated the passage of their age in childhood adolescence and even adulthood is comical and fantastic at the same time dragons fight mess do drugs get married divorce and die,positive
you forgot the most important and influential book of latin american magical realism the corner stone pedro paramo by mexican juan rulfo latin american writers influenced salman rushdie et al btw garcia marquez is a nobel prize laureate,positive
i thoroughly enjoyed this and im glad i already had a solid enough concept of magical realism yet this made me aware that culturally it made such a political impact my debut book just a little broken i like to think is in the same vein as the genre it allows a significant amount of freedom in storytelling especially within a realitybased land i appreciate all the information and nuances packed into these videos,positive
i feel like reading rushdies midnights children again now thankyou for the profound explanation cheers ,positive
excellent explanation i completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against eurocentrism but i think its scope is even bigger one aspect of magic realism is politically ideological that is the postcolonial stuff another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialisticscientific determinism this aspect is more philosophical and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical ie it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes this is just my personal opinion,positive
girl you saving me making this so simple and understandable,positive
thank you so much for this clear explanation i read the whole section in my textbook but i was still so lost,positive
thank you your videos are informative to the point and super useful,positive
you are a great presenter i think it is great to have an example to support your video my students have been encouraging me to include more and more examples some even say this is the best way they learn through seeing the good and bad of other students dissertations my channel was originally set up for my classes but now i want all to access we need to me one big supportive community regarding help with academic skills that lead to student success dr m d egan,positive
you have no idea how youve helped me throughout my research project with your articles and videos thank you,positive

i remember doing my literature review this year and go a very good grade thanks to youre formative information now whats due is my dissertation for sure ill be back,positive
thank you for explaining what is literature review i understand it very well,positive
me actually pausing the video to go get a cup of warm tea xd,positive
as a student of literature i fully agree with what youre saying in this video i almost use the same exact same arguments when someone asks me why i study literature lol i love how you and your mum discuss literature so casually and playfully thats some real family goals right there,positive
why i read and what book i read depends on my mood or my aims sometimes i read for a bit of escapism other times it’s to learn sometimes it’s both i love it when a book teaches you something that you never realised or expected and it stays with you and even changes your way of thinking,positive
emma you have the best nonbook channel book channel on yt,positive
i had forgotten about what it feels like reading a good book since its been awhile i havent taken a english class this semester but your thoughts made me remember all the reasons you talked about reinvigorates my curiosity to think about the human experience question the beliefsmindsets i currently have and well to study literature,positive
when you read a novel how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author for instance one of my favorite books is the master and margarita by mikhail bulgakov if you read it by itself it is such an interesting novel however learning the history of its writing in the background of stalins russia makes it even more interesting how much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners if at all,positive
i usually pick up a book for two reasons either because i like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality and that is why i read a lot of fantasy and horror or because i want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time for that is when i go to classics and more international literature also i totally agree with the people should read classics thing its so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations,positive
thank you for this video im currently curating my documents and this is helping me search based off of the keywords,positive
this should be titled how to search for a literature review not how to write one,negative
you are fantastic i am following all of your videos and its really simple and clearif you could offer the coarses on the website 360 for free for developing countries it would be marvellous,positive

this is so helpful just wanna say that thank you for helping me gain knowledge lol,positive
firstly screening the literature is the most important aspect of a systematic review and for any other types sonot teaching students how to use ovid medline cochrane tec and only relying on pubmed is certainly the worst start up you miss such a large number of studies that whatever conclusion you try to draw will be biased and therefore unreliable,negative

i admire people who kindly spread knowledge on this planet thank you very much for that free tutorial,positive
here is the transcript the literature review is not an essay it is not a research paper the literature review is part of your essay the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe standalone product if youre masters degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for but regardless of whether part of the research essay or standalone product one thing the literature review does not do is it doesn’t prove state illustrate collaborate or develop your main point thats in the body of your essay the literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper well what the heck does it do then well the literature review is divided into the following key terms first is the whole idea of what the heck in the literature the literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic now remember i said narrow topic we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic thats the first thing that you need to know the literature is published peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic second thing the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed what the heck of a review well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it what is that snapshot going to capture that snapshot going to capture major concepts the major point the major outcome the major whatever in that source it’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot once you get all those snapshot done you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of timeline situation maybe not but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element may be on a time line type of situation now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why theyre hack are you doing all this stuff well i think there are three reasons probably why youre doing all this stuffs in school in the first one off course to improve your own understanding as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding build your background build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline then in of course in this paper when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject youre going to be demonstrating that knowledge demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment but you know the real purpose of a literature review is it’s a reader service it something you doing as a favor for your readers what are you doing you are bringing them up to date what’s the first thing you and that old friend do you ask each other hey what you been doing all these years fill me in update me you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in you updating them by bringing them up to date then you can start at the present again you see what i’m saying you can bring them along that timeline of the path letting them know the key element the major concepts the key element in your life and what you dare boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literatures review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas past scholars the past researchers boom and then come your idea,negative

wayne is the kind of success story that encourages me as a underground artist with a small following seeing how he’s developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity he’s been giving has been inspirational mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason dude is too nice i know if i put in the work i can reach a larger audience some day too but for now i’m happy being a supporter my turn will come too salute to wayne,positive

i think this probably resonates with all of us who have been single a while after being in a serious relationship you get yourself into situations with people you like but couldn’t get serious with both playing a slight game with each other you like each other but don’t need each other both wanting to give each other late night calls sometimes resisting you feel all strong and happy to be independent all day enjoying life come home make yourself some food but come 89pm you often realise you actually don’t wanna be alone that night again and damn you should have arranged something with someone but now it’s maybe too late,positive

i really don’t know if their house value could go up or down up with the amount of stuff they’ve installed or down because they’ve took about 25 of the walls out ,negative
i’m actually pretty glad you added the secret vent door too because gaming consoles usually need ventilation so that the room itself wouldn’t over heat and that’s often left out in “secret room” builds,positive
i love how these guys are out here making the forts that we all wanted as kids,positive
awesome project guys but why not just put a hinge on the secret door so the bed would still be usable or maybe put a hydraulic platform so you can lift the bed and enter the secret room without actually putting a hole in the bed just my thoughts,positive
i would gladly pay for these guys to do something like this in my home,positive
looks like this youtuber will be the architect of an unusual building but epic,positive
this channel always has my favorite songs i love it sm,positive
pls add this on spotify,positive
thank you for posting so much ,positive

its nice to see these very quick unscripted breaking news type of videos,positive
if people want to worship one mans words and previous actions to the point where they buy a stock on command at an elevated price then its their own damn fault,negative
if you don’t do something about your financial situation your income remains unchanged while expenditures keep rising these got me seeking the best answers to invest my 50k any ideas here,negative
i think more than anything the meme stock phenomenon is a protest against the vitriol exhibited towards the retail investor with that said i do and like having a small portion of my portfolio reserved for speculation having made some good money off of picks like amc and bbby it’s small enough where it doesn’t hurt my long term investment goals and strategy and large enough to “have fun” with as long as you don’t put more down than you’re willing to lose and fully acknowledge it’s a casino have fun with it just be safe set your stop limits and take profit as you go not financial advice just how i conduct myself,positive
ah bbby yes thank you i threw in a little bit of money and ended up tripling it thank you i am too wimpy to go big but i am happy with the small win never throw a large sum into something this volatile,positive

the fact that her life is so relatable to ours makes me want to be influenced by her lmao,positive
i like how emma doesn’t need someone around her she’s able to enjoy her day without anyone,positive
i was so brainwashed by the whole life of an influencer from social media that i never realized that theyre just like normal people seeing her journal lay in bed with her cats without the chaos of having a million things to say all for the sake to keep us entertained that really made me cry a bit i love how raw her content is now i feel so at peace thanks emma,positive
this new editing style makes me feel so emotional not in a bad way just every single time i watch them i feel so many good emotions love this new style emma and from the looks of the comments everyone else is enjoying it too you are truly an artist,positive

nice beds if you like the bed sheets to look crisp like they were just ironed make the bed and then lightly mist spray the sheets including the pillowcases with plain water using a standard spray bottle this works on cotton sheets which will stretch out as the mist of water dries out it is a luxury hotel trick the sheets will look pristine especially white sheets,positive

11 years passed already time flies she was so authentic and genuine full of the special talent rest in peace amy ,positive
frank was a bomb ass album great lyrics with infectious beats and sassy themes amy was enjoying her music then and being a musician the fame and limelight was there yet after this album the critique and scrutiny awakened her many insecurities i guess sigh but what a talent she was great,positive
she was soooo healthy here hair healthy skin healthy body healthy just so youthful and ripe for the world man i wish we could have gotten more time with her,positive
kinda sucks how people mostly talk about how they wish she was healthy and how unhealthy she was just listen to her voice and seal your lips her voice will speak to you and the composition will answer your questions just let go of wishing something better,negative

the car just randomly exploding after the gate closed looked like a planned assasination this made me laugh so hard,positive
if you hold c you can move props around without moving your character youll look like youre standing perfectly still,positive
i’m scared that bubs is gonna get too popular and that he won’t be able to make these videos without getting recognized lmao,negative
it blows my mind that people are on the internet simulating police traffic stops,negative
ah yes the invisible physgun technique used to do the same stuff back in 2014 much fun ,positive
i love how they say nitrp but when you commit crimes a flying police men flies out of nowhere and freezes you in air,negative

“you are being transphobic” ugh these people are absolutely insufferable these people actually willingly surround themselves with other people like this,negative
let’s take a moment to appreciate the other chill feminists in the vc,positive
as a woman his argument is completely valid it takes two to tango and if one member gets pregnant then they both have to discuss further progress you cant just get pregnant with someones child and go off and abort unless is was an assault situation in which the woman has absolute control of what comes next because thats a horribly traumatic event the woman has to go over proceedings with the man,negative
as a member of the nico community we need to get rid of her,negative
if anything i feel bad for nico being so paranoid and insecure that she automatically assumes everyone is harassing her regardless of whats being said even someone with the same name was enough to make her feel threatened must be so draining you know no wonder she sounds like shes always on the verge of tears shes also a discord mod so no surprise there i hope she gets the help she needs,negative
“if abortions are legal how come british people are still born” is probably the best pro life argument i think i’ve heard,positive
calling someone “racist” or “phobic” with no evidence to back it up shows true ignorance,negative
joe your grandma big as shit dawg had me dying,negative
why does derrick have a pad on his forehead ,negative
im literally dying of laughter this guy is so funny,positive

thanks for this owen watching this guy lose his poop constantly on one hand is entertaining but he is doing real damage to unsuspecting people who have fallen for his rhetoric as a christian people like him make the saner ones among us cringe constantly i do not expect everyone to believe but we all have to live together and need to treat everyone with dignity human kindness there is no place in our society for this kind of hate,negative
i have to admit this is hilarious however its also sad the fact that theres a remote possibility of this guy or anyone for that matter truly believing in this crap is disheartening and makes me lose faith in humanity really sets us back a few hundred years also if the devil were real this guy would undoubtedly be doing his bidding and not that of any loving god by preaching hate and encouraging division amongst people,negative
as an actual witch i find it absolutely hilarious that this “burning service” of his resembled a ritual in almost every way,negative
this is obviously terrifying but can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that he is attempting to cleanse objects of negative energy with the element fire thats legit one of the witchiest acts of witchcraft out there lmao,negative
as a “real” witch complete with all of my spell books and tarot cards i think it’s absolutely hilarious how the witch paraphernalia that he was burning was just maleficent and harry potter merchandise lmao,positive
as someone who got away from an unknown prophetess who shared a similar view its scary that he actually has a following while it is hilarious and admirable someone trolled their book burning i find it scary since that only served to strengthen and prove him right in his mind and in his following im just scared if they actually start to become dangerous to that man and us its a trolling joke but to those people and greg its real and not a game,negative
dude the british kid went from an annoying kid to an absolute chad in the span of a few minutes honestly props to him for trolling with soup,negative

i love how when gibi asks for options she doesnt specify which one we pick for example she asks which one would you like then she says okay perfect and no matter what someone picks it seems really interactive also love the attention to detail with the airplane cups thanks so much for the relaxation and content you provide for us 3,positive
id love a everything is wrong version of this with us the viewers being the only ones on the flight and were in a rusty old plane that could drop at any given point perhaps daisy could be the flight attendant,positive
the attention to detail is unmatched the background noise the safety demonstration even the cups were like aeroplane cups,positive
i don’t even have any allergies but the consciousness of allergens is so comforting idk why  i know it’s really scary traveling with allergies for you gibi so i can imagine how nice it would be to hear those words from a flight attendant,positive

latte is so incredible i am a teen and struggle with anxiety depression ocd adhd paranoia body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria ptsd and dissociative issues as well as chronic pain so it is usually very difficult for me to feel relaxed and fall asleep i discovered latte two years ago and it changed my life she is so soothing and comforting without being condescending annoying or repetitive and her videos are always incredibly high quality i’ve watched all of her videos including the ones in languages i don’t understand and there wasn’t a single video i didn’t like i love and appreciate latte so much 33,positive
the airline realness here is out of this world the white china the way the food is plated the picture on the back wall its just outstanding,positive
i and hopefully other people would love to see a “behind the scene” of the making on of these videos,positive
this woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice some asmrtists as fine as they are do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners there are patterns of sounds which means some sounds will cause relaxation other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers dont realize that these cannot be mixed me for an example hate very high pitched noises hate plastic and eating sounds latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos she just knows whats up,negative
whenever you tell us to breathe in and breathe out it instantly relaxes me you are the only asmr person that has given me complete relaxation in such a simple manner your voice is just perfect for this,positive
latte is so passionate she even bought a plane for us ,positive
omg i just noticed that the sun is setting outside the windows… the attention to detail latte puts into every video is just incredible,positive
c’est incroyable de faire des vidéos d’une qualité folle tous les jours merci à toi de m’endormir tous les soirs bonne nuit à tous,negative

thank you for not putting in ads like imagine listening to this at night and then just hearing writing is not that easy but grammarly can help,positive
i’ve never seen such a long preview this just proves that this asmrist really puts in the effort for us,positive
just take the time to appreciate that she took the time to make a three hour asmr video and put the timestamps in two different languages and with no ads,positive
the fact that she takes her time so that we can hear more outstanding noisessounds she also puts a decent amount of time in to every sound and she takes her free time to get herself ready prepare everything that she wants to use and then spend over 3 hours for us,positive

read me i forgot to answer the first question on the screen im sorry my answer is id rather pick talk to animals even if it wasnt a perfect communication would be unbelievable to be the only person who could do that sorry hope yall see this before getting mad at me for skipping it lol also i reference asmr galaxys channel if you love watching would you rathersipad sounds this video is directly inspired from theirs definitely check them all out so many great videos,positive
your handwriting is so amazing it’s actually visual asmr for me,positive
omg now you gotta make this into a series your ipad videos i remember the first one with testing out brushes was the reason why i started my asmr channel now i’m expecting a large series with 5 parts of would you rather lovely you’re the best  thank you for the mention i don’t think i even deserve it ,positive
love so much that youre a jojo fan what a relaxing video i love the tapping sounds,positive
my life is complete knowing that gibi has used one of my examples lol ,positive
can we just talk about how nice gibi’s handwriting is,positive
couldn’t get enough of the ipad tapping sounds these questions were great would like a sequel possibly with some original characters would be interesting to see officer barts answers to some of these questions,positive
it’s currently midnight even though i’m so tired i know it’s worth it and i already know it will love your vids keep em up and goodnight everyone,positive
the ipad tapping sounds really good the writing too i really like this background since it helps me watch it before i sleep,positive
hope yall see this before getting mad at me for skipping it lol i personally wouldnt get mad for something like that  but still im glad ive read the description first before watching the video like i always do ,positive
my mom used to play one of these with me ours was growing a vegetable patch you would till the soil and make the rows then planting the seeds and naming each type of veggie as you went then covering the seeds with dirt and then rain falling over them all and sunshine shining on them to help them grow tt u tt very good childhood memories indeed these were great to listen to thank you so much for sharing and triggering a lot of us in the best of ways,positive
erin they bite you they bite you me is relaxed and sleepy asmr is weird sometimes,negative
some little time stamps 3 230 treasure island  658 kittens  935 cool winter night  1218 happy birthday  1406 beach ,positive
i love the clear visible and audible pleasure erin takes in lines like its a snake and it attacks,positive
i havent thought of these since my mom passed away when i was young since she used to this to help me sleep at night this was really relaxing and these were so nice to hear again,positive
the nostalgia on this was off the charts my earliest asmr experience as a kid along with playing with hair were these back tracing games,positive
the version we did as kids where i live was honestly a bit weird the direct translation would be three knives to the back blood runs down spiders crawling in your hair snakes round your neck crack an egg on your head and the yolk runs down and then youd usually say boo or something maybe lightly push the person as youre saying it too so yea pretty hardcore for a bunch of 6 year olds lol,negative
such a nostalgic thing for me my mom used to help me sleep with these every other night in my country we call them wierszykimasażyki which roughly translates to massage poems loved the video,positive
this stuff is so interesting my version of the shiveries was so much shorter and had like half of the same elements its cool how much these things change from place to place and time to time,positive
“there’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down … there’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down” “i’m sleeping with pam’s mom sometimes dinner”,negative
hi all i hope you enjoyed d if you want more videos of the characters ill link here daisy lorelei sybil luna mistletoe bart robyn pompom fleeb florb tatyana sybil bart daisy and lorelei give you manicures ps if you want to see the signature page ill post it on my ig story,positive
being a british person myself gibi an american actually did a good job of doing a fairly convincing english accent as robyn literally never thought id say an american would ever do that but there ya go edit thanks for 12k likes,positive
i love that robyns signature is literally an x marks the spot,positive
sybil giving us some tea and essentials for the road is the cutest thing ever shes so mumsy and this is why i love her shes probably my favourite character in the gibiverse ,positive
no one talking about pompom shes like someone who would sit and listen to you while in your darkest moments and when your bored she always has good ideas to help you i love pompom and love to see more of her and lorelei too,positive
the fact that no one’s talking abt luna saying “want a quickie oh i shouldn’t say that”,negative
can i say bart is just an amazing addition to gibis world of characters,positive
daisy dont say hi to lorelei i owe her money pov character goes to lorelei first and gives her a paper that says daisy and nothing else damn we savage,negative
the most impressive thing about this video is the fact that each character has their own thought out and individual signature thats some ace character creation,positive
leave a thumbs up for your favorite trigger and goodnight,positive
let the anxiety melt away let the overthinking stop for awhile you deserve relaxation you deserve comfort be kind to yourself please ,positive
her nails be on point every single video and it’s so satisfying,positive
the bassy sound of the lint comb is so unique its a weird but wonderful cross between a cat purring and a frog croaking,positive
your nail tapping has the most unique sound but the quality of your asmr is what stands out the most it is by far one of my essential can’t live without nightly routines,positive
ive been watching asmr for years and ive never had these kind of affects omg thank you so much ,positive
yes pleaseee right as i opened youtube to fall asleep literal perfect timing i don’t know if i’ve ever been this early haha thank you for another super tingly video,positive
hope your nights have been well people i know i personally struggle alot daily with anxiety and such but its always best to find something that calms you down at the end of the day i hope those of you watching this for maybe your anxiety or insomnia find the necessary peace you need tonight struggle is just another path towards a new destination and you will meet the end eventually from one challenge to another we keep growing anyhow this message goes out to everyone i hope you are all doing well and are safe somewhere tonight sleep well ,positive
hi love your asmr and creativity ,positive
install raid for free  iosandroidpc and get a special starter pack  available only for the next 30 days,positive
honestly you could make anything sound nice gibi it’s you the items you use are just a bonus,positive
gibi “thinks” she’s got some things that will sound nice  i’m quite confident they will be amazing ,positive
the usps store in my hometown is atleast the times ive been in there very quiet and simple the workers are soft spoken and sweet and i cant even remember music being played really its not an awkward quiet but a comforting one with a little bit of paper shuffling background noise,positive
her whisper voice is so clicky and precise and perfect and it’s so relaxing i’ve never heard another asmrtist with such a satisfying natural voice,positive
gibi the answer is always yes we like everything you do we want all the vids ,positive
1 incredibly excited for the fairy post office the tiny envelopes and wax seals 2 i adore the idea of a pen shop role play 3 i like both show and tell and trigger videos you should make whichever one you feel like at the time,positive
your rps are out of this world amazing i’m still vibing from the trojan war medical muselyre player but as this video shows and as we all know just “plain” gibi excuse the oxymoron isn’t too bad either excuse the understatement thanks for the zs edit follows actually i should not say gibi’s role plays are “out of this world” they are in this world they portray pieces of who we are or want to be or pieces of people we know or want to know or of people we have met or want to meet or of friends or personal assistants we have or want to have and this is just one reason why they are so amazing,positive
when you were talking about possibly doing a fairy post office i imagined it being inside of a flower one soft color with little lights either warm or cool depending on the color of the flower ,positive
why is his voice so calming it’s so normal but soft and cool at the same time never heard such a interesting and nice voice,positive
it’s a little thing but the consistency between haircuts is comfy like when u rly get to know ur barber as a person,positive
your voice is so calming and you easily put me to sleep and that’s definitely not a bad thing i couldn’t sleep until 2 am you just got a new sub ,positive
i have bad social anxiety and anxiety attacks and stuff and started listing to you at night now during the day if me anxiety sneaks up i’m also a recovering addict and these video’s wee brilliant man thank you,positive
haircut asmr is probably my favorite its so satisfying,positive

i love this man this is so relaxing keep up the amazing work,positive
the lap videos are always so amazingly comforting love the little rings on your nails and the sound they make while you trace really nice video ,positive
glad to see you did this again and you added long nails these lap videos give me such a safe and cozy feel it makes me so sleepy before i can even finish the video,positive
1011 love that the camera focused just in time to see the confusion haha also those fingernail ring things make a really great sound thanks for this pls tell your neck were sorry,positive
your asmr is so calming and soothing ,positive
listening to this with earbuds for the first time in a long time and it’s rly a whole new experience it’s soooo good  edit i used to listen to asmr without any earphones and was fine for once i thought about using them pls don’t be weird in the comments lol,positive
just saw this came out cant wait to hit the sack in a couple of hours and fall asleep to it thanks so much love your videos ,positive
amazing visuals and her voice is amazing this is so calming i will fall asleep in no time,positive
this is super relaxing i enjoy your positive affirmations especially from this angle as your comforting words combined with your lovely hand sways give lots of tingles thanks glow ,positive

i was dying laughing at all the background noise even then i loved your reaction to it honestly it wasn’t even that bad,positive
the fuck off had me dying i always love your follow instructions videos,positive
150 made me feel that tingly feeling between my eyes it was perfect,positive
the background noise actually added to the comfort for me because i felt like i was just hanging with a old friend at their place in the real world the imperfection makes things feel safe,positive
when you dont cut out background noises but use them as your advantage is the way of a true asmrtist,negative
getting that raven feel with your hair color from teen titans it looks rad love it ,positive
thanks luna bloom this really put me in such a relaxed trance like state ,positive

im chineseaustralian and i started thinking about what my ideal comfort food would be when i started watching this video it turned out that i had a very similar experience with the chinese lady in this video as well my parents sometimes made congee with cabbage and chicken in the morning and it was the best meal i could ever have wanted i also requested this when i was sick and also when i got braces on because i could only eat soft foods it really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is,positive
my comfort food is maggibeing an indian i literally grew up eating ityou can just eat it anytimeevery indian loves it,positive
im filipino and my favorite comfort food is called bananacue its basically banana covered with crunchy caramel but typically we dont use just normal bananas we use a kind of banana called sabah and its like banana but bigger and a little bit firmer typically served on a stick but its up to you on how you want it served,positive
im polish and my comfort food is pierogi ruskie its dumplings with potato cheese and garlic filling boiled and then fried in bacon fat with crispy bits of bacon and sometimes caramelized onion sprinkled on top with a bit of butter for that extra creamy taste i can eat them by kilograms,positive
i dont know why everyone is disliking the british one for me i think comfort foods means that you can have it all the time whether youre happy sad tired exhausted or energetic personally i dont even like bread and toast but for him it might be his comfort food which he can have it all the time whenever he wants to without even thinking about the preparations to make for a grand food xx,negative
being british the best comfort food is at chinese takeaway their bbq sweet ribs are perfect they fall off the bone and you get to eat the sweet crunchy cartilage and if you like it the bone marrow it’s perfect to eat and the sauce in the tub left over in thick and sweet and perfect for the chips they sell that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside hope i described it well edit also marmite and cheese inbetween 2 pieces of toast just jjejjsjsjsjsjjssjisisjenjd,positive
a fellow mexican here and i have two different comfort foods for when i want something sweet i go with arroz con leche because its good for any time of the day and can be eaten cold or hot which means its good for literally any time of the year and my other comfort food is definitely pozole it is just so good and warm and it gives me memories of all the parties i went to when i was a child,positive
does anyone else watches these videos as a torture challenge while youre hungry as hell,negative
as a native chicagoan i can safely say portillos is pretty great the italian beef and their crinkle fries are both so so good however as someone who visits missouri yearly you can never say no to lions choice it puts arbys to shame with real roast beef gotta get it with swiss and au jus with a fountain ibc root beer it doesn’t get much better than that,positive
i loved your list really well put together having lived in wa and born in oregon i can attest that both restraunts are very important to us,positive
as a native idahoan i can attest to the fact that boise fry company is amazing they have a buffalo burger that is divine and i prefer the purple yam or sweet potato with fry sauce and blueberry ketchup,positive
i was born and raised in anchorage and i can all but guarantee you that while tommys is atbest pretty standard its an absolute tourist trap and has been since i was born in 1993 go to long branch saloon for burgers and if you want a more alaskan experience try to go for a salmon quesadilla from salmon express during saturday market my recommendation is to order it spicy but even getting a regular is going to be excellent even if youre not big on seafood,positive
went to north carolina for my cousins wedding back in october 2018 mentioned that we were going to go to bojangles the following day we had two people at our table that were close friends of the bride and groom the groom being my cousin they immediately got excited and told us we had to go there it holds the record for being the only place whose biscuits i love i am a native seattleite and have had likely hundreds if not thousands of dicks burgers fries and shakes throughout my life in high school we had them for lunch every saturday good times good times,positive
that was an awesome list and i agree with all of the places that i’ve been to personally can’t wait to try the ones i’ve never been to,positive

as a european who loves italianstyle pizza one of my culinary dreams is to travel to new york to try their pizza but also to chicago to try the deep dish one awesome thing about the usa being so big and so diverse is that you can find literally every type of cuisine there both genuine and americanized,positive
i know i’m late on this video but it’s absolutely criminal that tennessee’s signature food wasn’t nashville hot chicken considering how big it’s gotten,negative
im from md and can confirm our love of blue crabs albeit most people i know would rather get a dozen steamed crabs and pick it themselves than get a crabcake just because picking crabs on the bay is a fun nostalgic activity i suppose crab cakes are usually preferred by touristspeople who want to stay cleancivilized meals haha seriously though if you come to md in the summer go to cantlers or mikes crab house near the bay bridge you wont be dissapointed,positive
as someone who grew up in new jersey i do love salt water taffy but sub sandwiches are the real iconic food from nj the term submarine sandwich was coined in my hometown of paterson by an italian immigrant thanks wikipedia white house subs in atlantic city is one of the jersey shores oldest sub shops and of course the jersey mikes chain started from in pt pleasant yes your local deli probably makes a better sandwich but jms subs are at least far superior to subway,positive
im from tennessee and frankly im quite disappointed yall put memphis ribs over nashville hot chicken its literally our staple food at this point considering how big hot chicken has gotten,negative
as a west virginian i can confirm that pepperoni rolls are definitely what i was hoping to see ,positive

nikhil had so much energy and was actually trying the food makes me want to travel to india just for the mcds food,positive
i love that basically everything has a vegetarian option in india i’m kind of jealous,positive
there are actually 2 extremely different mcdonald’s menu’s in india i am from north india and over there most of the things are different from the menu shown in the video edit the comments are actually telling me that there are two official distributors of mcdonald’s in india and because of that the menu’s vary drastically which is pretty interesting actually and you guys could do a food wars seasonspin off showing the regional differences between fast food chains in india itself,positive
nikhil is genuinely the best person to represent indian food on global media he knows his shit and how to accurately talk about indias various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds,positive
i love how crystelles part was a really serious and well presented historygeography lesson and they cut to nikhil just be like its like crack lmfao,positive
kinda want to try indian mcdonalds after this the masala potato wedges and the other sides look pretty good and the paneer burgers would be fun to try,positive
when a british person say its the real deal it puts a little fear in our little indian heart  if you dont get this you need a history lesson,negative
we need more of nikhil on food wars the pre planned banter between joe nikhil is damn funny ,positive
dominos india used to do twisties twistie bread they used to be these long braided dough with garlic butter and oregano seasoning brushed on top long time back they were an off menu item and the cheapest thing at dominos these teiesties were decentralized and being a broke college student the twisties helped me a lot,positive
i love how brutal the commentary is in this one its about time somebody puts dominos in its place i never really understood why people like them so much but to each their own i guess its just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for btw nikhil is so funny i hope you have him on more often,negative
i have wanted to visit india forever to experience authentic indian food it’s my favorite cuisine but based on these videos i’m almost tempted to go just to try the indianized version of our crappy american fast food that i never eat in the states the curiosity is kind of killing me now ,negative
dominos india have deteriorated a lot over the years their cheese burst doesnt burst anymore stuffed garlic bread doesnt have cheese in it and most importantly they dont use cheese anymore its all vegoil based cheese substitute even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before i used to love dominos before but now its a nightmare,negative
ive been living in india for almost 10 years now and prefer its pizzas much over the western menu i still remember my first year in india seeing a big dominos ad where theyd advertise two new pizzas with exotic vegetables the exotic vegetables being broccoli and zuccini goes to show that exotic is very much a question of perspective,positive
fyiwe also have garlic breadsticks stuffed garlic breadcheese dominator1 pound of mozzarella cheese melted on the pizza5 cheese pizza1 out of those 4 cheeses is a ghost pepper flavoured cheeseparatha pizzared velvet lava cake and butterscotch mousse cakewhich is the most heavenly thing available on the whole dominos menu but its also true that these items are region specific thats why it is there in kolkatawest bengal but not in bangalore,positive
loving this series we get such boring dominos pizzas here in the uk the us pizzas looked good the indian ones were interesting to see i’d really like to try that apple dip and cinnamon sugar dough dessert from the us and the indian chocolate lava cake looked yummy,positive
i’m so jealous of all those cool vegetarian options,negative

i love teriyaki mcburger,positive
ive only known george for 22 minutes but hes too precious,positive
when i lived in japan about 17 years ago macdonalds had a burger called the mcgrand it had a creamy dijon mustard sauce and a thick beef patty along with lettuce tomatoes and so on it was so good that i still think about it occasionally i was really disappointed when i moved back to canada and it wasnt on the menu here,positive
the japanese packaging is cute i’m also surprised mcfloats aren’t a thing here but the ice cream machines are always down so maybe that’s a factor,positive
i used to work as a manager at mcdonald’s in canada and i also travel to japan often so when i do get mcdonald’s in japan i often like to try something different there it’s been a few years since i last went partly due to covid… but i tried the locomoco burger and hawaii blue drink and both were pretty good oh and the teriyaki burgers are pretty good,positive
also who thinks they should send me to tokyo to try the exclusives irl that’d be a good series right,positive
funny to see a teriakyi burger i cant have tomatoes due to gerd and other issues so i tried to find a replacement to sauce my burgers with i tried teriyaki on my homemade hamburger and it was a great alternative funny enough japans mcdonalds does the same thing lool my at home one was fantastic so i have no doubt they love it,positive
the japanese saucepackaging is awesome this is probably the coolest thing ive ever seen at mcdonalds,positive
a number of years ago mcd did a limited global menu thing where they brought a few of their international exclusives to the us i think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that i remember was a burger from spain and a stroopwafel mcflurry from the netherlands i dont remember trying the spanish burger it really wasnt anything that different the stroopwafel mcflurry was awesome tho was sad to see it go anyway i knew a little bit about the japanese exclusive items and was hopeful theyd continue it and do a run with a few of those here the mcteriyaki burger sounds awesome and im surprised they havent tried the mcfloats here ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the us and it would be so easy a dr pepper mcfloat would be really good for us taste im also kind of upset they ditched the snack wraps probably a us exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around they had 3 that i remember big mac a barbecue crispy chicken one and i think a bacon ranch one wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito i think you got 2 per order and they were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if thats what one was hungry for on the go,positive
deadass all this looks 10x better than my school food,positive

food insider hit the jackpot with nikhil as the host for indian food he does a really good job i have one request and that is that you dont waste food by throwing it out after taking just one bite and instead cut off a piece from where you took the bite and offer it to someone who doesnt have food itll make that persons day and you wouldnt lose a thing,positive
i remember getting in line for a subway at delhi int airport there was a line of say 6 people of which 4 were nonindians i was getting late and the line seemed huge i was also wondering why so many foreigners were eating vegetarian then one of them got in the front and the cashier told him that the nonveg line was on the other side and then they looked up and spotted that they were standing in the vegetarian line the entire queue moved and i got my sub in time for my flight fun times,positive
631 chana is a smaller variety of chickpea whereas daldaal is called lentils in english that aside great video and i really love nikhils sense of humour and style of presentation,positive
nikhil is crushing this series love him,positive

this is a very good idea imagine getting like a calzone stuffed with grilled chicken an alfredo sauce possibly a garlic butter brushed on top of the calzone  i’m going to go make one rn,positive
i gave my 19 year old son the joshua weismann cookbook for “easter” i’m a mom of grown males i use any excuse to gift my kids things he sends me recipes so i can shop them before he comes out to my house he didn’t really cook before crackin’ your book he then brings the cookbook with him so we can cook meals togethersomething his older brother and i have done since he was four it’s nice  we will be doing some similar combos once he watches this videoguaranteed ,positive

one time i had leftover bbq pulled pork and leftover fettuccine in the fridge i mixed them together and baked it in the oven until crispy i know italians and texans were collectively losing their minds but it tasted freaking amazing so who cares ,positive
ive hated calzone until the day i made it by myself at home every time i tried calzone in a fast food restaurant the filling was like boiled inside and just blah i dont like it this way stopped ordering started cooking it,negative
id never make my own mozzarella too much responsibility desi is a level 3 human being,negative

desi is delightful im not gonna make homemade sauce its already in the store thats a man who works for a living,positive
desi is hilarious we need more of him with a deep fryer that oil gets on you you gotta go to the hospital its dangerous facts,negative
love all three i want to try and prepare level three’s recipe but pair it with beth’s sauce level one was the backbone of this video lol his lack of time spent making the food was made up with his commentary lol he was so relatable for the everyday person,positive
the pizza planet pizza being awful is just disney sticking to the bit since in universe its basically chuck e cheese,negative

i simply love how this team is always revisiting countries they already done in the past  and this ep is a vnoice surprise pancit palabok is my 1 fav noodle dish and what was shown here is close enough maynila’s take to palabok to what that humble and timeless dish is all about since most dishes including this one has numerous iterations spanning not just country wide but on a global scale now days keep it up y’all,positive
i love sonnys enthusiasm to eat unfamiliar foods he didnt show any grimace or fear of eating by the way we dont eat some of these foods everyday except for palabok lomi and pares some foods are normally eaten during feasts and parties to enjoy with other people i love how mr chui guides sonny on filipino dishes more power to your show ,positive

i love how nikhil is just being the best when it comes to explaining vegetarianism in indialike we dont need a veg biriyaniwho even invented them,positive
as someone who is following channels like buzzfeed tasty food insider and many more channels who review food of india vs other countries since 2017 ill have to agree that i genuinely enjoyed this video the editing the humour the variety everything is just so indulging and fun to watch rather than your average countless food comparison videos which feel like theyre all the same this was refreshing to watch kudos looking forward to more of this content,positive
welcome nikhil can’t wait to learn more from you about all that delicious indian fast food ,positive
you should check out kenyas kfc its wild we have a bucket with 9121518 and 21pcs chicken wraps called twisters my fav is the spicy rice bowl hash brown burgers nyama nyama burgers which is a burger without bunsbuns are chicken pieces instead chicken nuggets krushers which is a milkshake with crushed cookies i like mine with oreos box master and crunch master which is like a shawarma and lastly kfc chicken saladi almost forgot the double crusher burger with 2 pieces of chicken  im now hungry ,positive
i love this nikhil guy more of him please,positive
yes dinner and dancing at lotte mart this is the kind of episode i’ve been missing less gold leaf on caviar more 711 and asian grocery stores,positive
watching strictly dumpling while eating my dinner is the most luxurious part of my day honestly feels like i’m eating with mikey,positive
having dinner and watching mikey after a busy college day i was just wondering why do i like these asian groceries stores videos so much its amazing the variety of pre made meals and frozen food they have everything look so good and mikey said some of them are like eating from a restaurant impressive really,positive
you are making me want to go to south korea more now mike if even supermarket food is that good over there how can i resist,positive
thats like eating out of a restaurant thats because restaurants freeze their foods like their fresh pasta too haha its good to see a video thats more down to earth than the constant expensive places,positive
ive always wanted to try this in asia but havent gotten the chance to since i started doing this after the pandemic… but next chance i get i’m going for sure and doing a whole day there  thanks for even more inspiration mike you’re the best ,positive
they all looked great and delicious i love dim sum and cooked some up today some of the dumplings that i never have had were the soup dumplings omg…they are absolutely awesome and delicious cheers mikey another great video,positive
i found those churro chips in a local h mart and they are seriously addicting had to stop myself before eating the whole bag right after opening it,positive
the korean orion new four layers turtle chip corn soup flavor and the chocolate churro flavor are simply the best so glad it was showcased here for more people to know about how good it is,positive
i love these types of videos all that pre made and frozen food looks and i can only imagine how good it is thank you mike,positive
i love how he doesn’t talk or make unnecessary faceshe just eats,positive
i like when asmr channels never include the cooking and straight to the eating but this channel is still always good,positive
this guy is by far the absolute best mukbanger ive ever listened to ever,positive
i love that this guy always smiles and he enjoys what he is doing,positive
it looks like zach is living his best life and is happy when eat i have so relatable ,positive
all that food looks delicious ,positive
first video im seeing and i would love to eat what he cooks already  looks good,positive
watching him cook is so satisfying,positive
as a fellow immigrant to korea whos now living in vietnam i have to agree with these judgments especially how lotteria chefs took a quick look at a burger and tried to recreate it off sight alone the only thing id add is that the mozzarella sticks at lotteria are the best ive had from any restaurant over here,positive
lol omfg all this time i also thought lotteria was korean my bad,negative
this is why english teachers are high in demand im dead  ,positive

mark you found the right guy to bring you around kf seetoh is a legend in singapore,positive
yummy street food i like those foods ,positive
for those who dont know kf seetoh is a legendary street food critic in singapore he has really shine light on the traditional cooking methods and food culture and guided the likes of anthony bourdain etc through his long career i also personally respect that he does not put on airs or care about visuals the way other singaporean food influencers do he really cares 100 about the food edited for grammar,positive
incredible job on that video he is an icon to local food and has been pushing hard to promote the industry i think you found the right man to introduce singapore hawker food i saved almost 90 on my flights using mighty  travels  premium,positive
this gentleman seetoh made this video a delight usually i watch everything you do expecting your take on certain foods this man had amazing knowledge of expressly singaporian dishesand it was extraordinary thank you,positive
love the fact that hes able to give us the history behind all the singapore favorites he was also a friend of anthony bourdain if you bourdain fans may recall,positive
such a joy to watch kf seetoh his passion for the local food scene the way he celebrates the hawkers and food stall owners couldnt stop smiling the entire video 2948 was touching love the guy,positive
glad that mark chose to work with seetoh someone who has lived the 70s80s someone who has tasted and knows how authentic singapore streethawker food in the 70s80s were like and how they were authentically prepared and the ingredients originally used in that erathings that young people wouldnt know,positive
as a singaporean im so glad to see kf seetoh introduce all the food in less wellknown not the chinatown complex hong lim or golden mile hawker centres thats locally loved,positive
i love how uncle seetoh just goes in the stalls like nobodys business because hes a living legend xd,positive
thank you very much for giving me this precious opportunity i’m really honored to work with you amazing food war’s team arigatou gozaimasu and i’m looking forward to watching new food wars us vs india episodes,positive
george is just living his best life in this episode lol joe looks like he’s grounded while all his friends are out playing ,positive
so apparently the japanese 7elevens are like mini togo restaurants while the ones in the us serve packaged processed food or reheated frozen processed garbage its almost an insult to call them the same store how do we let them get away with this crap here,negative
theres no comparison between us 7 elevens and the 711 in asia dramatic difference on quality of food and service for ppl who live in the us and want to experience the asia 711s go to hawaii 711s are run by different companies in asia which explains the significant difference as an american i barely go to 711 except if i need a drink food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk high or dont care,negative
it seems in this series that george enjoys what he eats way more than joe does 3,positive
i’m upset that japan’s 711 has actual proper food where we have nothing but junk food anyways i’m excited that you guys are branching out to india,positive
me as a european am always so surprised about the drink sizes in the us how can the smallest soda be 651ml that would in the netherlands be enough for the entire family i mean in japan they have 1l and 15 liter packages but they are clearly to pour in glasses and share they arent portion sized,negative
the japanese chocolate doughnut looks much better than the one you’d get in america or here in the uk,positive
george is always saying how “yummy” everything was so when he said “it tastes like st” i almost fell off my chair lmfao ,positive
who will go here to enjoy the food and claim the free drink thanks for watching please also follow my youtube channel to see great food pictures,positive

i cant explain exactly why this has become one of my favourite formats on the show but it really has i can never get enough of these,positive
mooshelle was really sucking it in for that fancy pants dance with chase,negative
i started thinking that moochelle looked like chase this episode then rhett said chase isnt moochelle and then chase and moochelle danced together so im glad we put that to rest so efficiently and definitively,positive
that therapist is a true professional to be able to hold it together with someone intentionally being like randy and treating it like any other session is admirable,positive
i am interested to see this series done by adding a mythical kitchen version into the mix,positive
at this point we need an episode of what link eats in a week… because i’m convinced he doesn’t eat anything with flavor or seasonings… like a toddler…,negative
i was really hoping for my favorite app potato skins but maybe a whole potato based episode would be good potato skins poutine mashed potatoes etc,positive
huge thank you to ali for making this trip possible follow him on ig alinhamdani get early access to videos and be the first to comment follow on instagram for more fun food videos besteverfoodreviewshow,positive

that’s amazing way of cooking cheers from ireland ,positive
whack that like button and i won’t fire manny today,negative
it’s so heart warming to see nick bring small time cooks like gordon to big time cooking,positive
oh damn i never realized hell’s kitchen is his actual restaurant no wonder he gets so pissed when people absolutely destroy expensive food that’s his baby,negative
as a uk citizen for 13 or 14 years the curry sauce with the fish and chips is definitely traditional my entire family loves it,positive
its really good to see nick helping out small chefs like gordon ramsey the community appreciates it nick,positive
thank you for supporting small businesses in these hard times you rock,positive
can we respect that nick constantly shows himself eating crab and lobster despite being allergic to shellfish what a goat,negative
the mashup of different pop all mixed together is called “swamp water” long time ago it was specifically coke and orange pop but has transformed to refer to basically a mix of different pops of random assortment it actually works well and is a go to for when i want something fun and youthful,positive
hey mark i really love all of your videos but this whole spain series is definitely your greatest work as of today in my opinion i actually built my holiday around some of the spots you visited during this trip keep up the great work you really inspire a lot of people cheers,positive
mark you are the reason i will be putting spain as a place to visit and eat at after this amazing food tour you have done this far every place you have showed us on your tour looks just absolutely amazing and stunning the ambiance and the energy of these chefs is just outstanding also the quality of the ingredients and the recipes they have shared with you is just mouth watering spain is now on my bucket list thank you for showing your experience there i am excited to see what is next,positive
gabriella “san sebastien is obsessed with raw ingredients and how they prepare them” spot on food seems so simple when you look at it that waybut so few do gabriella has been another perfect foil on your spanish tour these outstanding people youve worked with across spain have taken everything to a genuinely jawdropping level i love the format – working with people who are as passionate about food as you – and they simply take you to their favourite food spots genius im totally loving merrihue being with you nowill feel rather sad the next time hes not by your side in a video loving your work mark,positive
what i love about italy spain is the simplicity of preparing their food allowing the natural taste of the food to shine through in america we overcook over prepare our food the freshness of this food makes you feel like you never had true prepared food mark this is what sharing food is really about in your own words wow cant help but to appreciate you your show,positive
hands down gabriella is one of if not the best tour guide in marks channel she knows everything not just about the food but also the city of san sebastian,positive
would love to travel the  and eat food like mark his love for food and the culture and stories behind the dishes absolutely beautiful,positive
the genius of mark’s videos is his ability to take deep dives into countries and truly convey his experience after seeing james blick here i got hooked on his vlog just like i how i found joel’s and jlj’s vlog don’t change anything mark don’t go cable network or public television…just keep doing what you do,positive
im so glad to see reviews on food from spain i never knew anything about spanish food besides for western world spanish food like mexico to brazil i never was even interested i looking at spain as a food destination and now its definitely on my food bucket list so glad ive saved all the videos so if i ever go i can look book and plan a trip thanks mark and jeff and a big thanks to all of your guides on this trip im sure alot of these places would never be found easily,positive

i feel healthy watching him eat all that stuff,positive
i love how it took more time for him to eat popcorn than a whole entire chocolate cake,positive
the thing that i love about him is he doesn’t waste food and his thumbnails are real,positive
my old time favorite video from matt stonie thank you matt stonie for the entertainment of competitive eating,positive
matt stonie eats everything incredibly fast also matt stonie enjoys his icecream,positive
this is a delicious idea also his gf watching him like “” alsoalso imagine hearing him eat with no music or background noise for an entire filming session ,positive
this owner was one of the only one that i was on his side the whole time he was not egotistic not in denial accepts all the criticisms and opened to change he needs to be saved,positive
i love how his son let his dad rage at him knowing he needed to do it and being proud that he did it,positive
i ate here as a kid before during and after the filming of this episode my dad is vegan so we went here often the food was always great and the son was who my family usually interacted with he was always super nice you could imagine my surprise when i got older and saw this episode lol i never saw gordon ramsay but i saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast the potato pancake was my favorite on the menu its a shame the restaurant was sold and no longer exists,positive
this man is a very gentle soul its hard for him to get angry,positive
this is a really good episode lots of great moments the son getting excited about his dad standing up for himself the owner secretly shaking the pan while handcuffed the owner eating the plants straight from the pot a fun time,positive
so wonderful to see that guy love his dad so much that he wasnt even disturbed with his dad yelling at him recognised that it was apart of his dads growth as a manager and got so excited by it happening,positive
the son of the owner was very well spoken and respectful i really loved how he was honest with his dad but also showed a caring side as well,positive
i would literally eat here the owner was so respectful you could tell he has a big heart and willing to do what he can to improve the restaurant hes definitely not arrogant and takes criticism well,positive
the owner is so down to earth humble and nice if this is my boss i would literally work longer in that restaurant,positive
i respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best piece that ive ever seen on youtube hats off to you all love your videos ,positive
i love how preston is for kids but has adult jokes in it,positive
preston is type of guy who creates clickbait titles and clickbait thumbnails but the video ends up actually being what the title and thumbnail say so extra awesome points to him,positive
for me milk actually makes it 100x spicier even if im not eating something spicy just regular pasta burns my throat with milk,positive
the egg blew my mind we did some great research preston,positive
the reason it feels spicier when you drink water is because the water makes the spice spread around your mouth,positive
attention food wishers scam alert i have no other account names on youtube and do not offer any prizes or special deals unless the message is from this account its not me do not fall for scams by people using a similar name thank you,negative
chef john always coming through with the best stoner food,positive

i’m allergic to sunflower seeds and most storebought potato chips are cooked in sunflower oil so this opens up my life to potato chips thank you chef john,positive
chef john from beef wellington to potato chips in the microwave the man does it all,positive
i had to come back to say this works great i used olive oil spray though and lawrys season salt but same result very crunchy only 6 minutes in my micro so as chef john said watch them because everyones micro is different also kudos to the parchment paper trick to cut it round but i think i did one too many folds because i ended up with 2 parchment paper circles attached together ,positive
these look amazing  i hate the fact that store bought crisps im watching from the uk or chips are broken up into little pieces due to handling i guess thanks for sharing,positive

the editing and performance in this video is through the roof absolutely insane,positive
honestly your pink sauce looks good can i buy a bottle,positive
the gov’t must order her to stop the sale of this immediately especially if it’s that perishable and not shipped properly,negative
the fact that she doesnt even know what fda stands for along with how its all packaged the list could go on shows that this is obviously not safe,negative
me and my parents literally have a recipe for a sauce that looks like a pale version of the pink sauce weve been using it mainly for french fries and i love it so thanks i dont need to pay for this i can make it on my own and also it has probably less calories in it,positive
im honestly quite confused why she hasnt been taken to court yet she has a nutrition facts that make no sense,negative
it’s always absolutely delightful or even delicious to see scammers get publicly called out,positive

philipino cuisine is criminally underrated i’m mexican american from so california and believe it or not i went my first 23 years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunt’s filipina coworkers wasn’t until i started dating a half filipina half white girl i first got to try it at a legit restaurant i absolutely loved everything my family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when i realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment i felt like i found my long lost relatives haha that alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal… halohalo… are you kidding me filipinos that is crack cocaine in dessert form and everything else all of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro i love my mexican food and while i wouldn’t ever trade it for anything filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion,positive
nice to see you back in the philippines enjoying trying filipino dishes sonny ,positive
sonny you should try the adobo version of cooked frogs with tons of red small chili and garlic prepared by our very own locals its delicious,positive
i love that philipibes reminds me of my coubtry mexico the crickets here in mexico are prepared deliciously as well,positive
this man is the man he has more knowledge about filipino food than my fellow filipinoa whos in this video edit wala naman po ako sinabing pangit kay ate gurl pinuri ko lang yung vlogger haha,positive
the side dish is called smoked shotgun shells its been super popular for the last couple of years on a lot of bbq channels and at bbq competitions,positive
guga needs to have december simply be a best of month where he spends an entire month redoing some of his easier best experiments and comparing what the best experiments of the year were i would love that,positive
judging by angel and leos reactions it seems like gugas cooking just gets better and better every video,positive
that movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called “butter salt” brand name flavicol the compounds that give butter it’s buttery taste can be made artificially or extracted from actual butter then mixed with salt as a powder this is then mixed with oil and that’s what movie theaters use you should dry age with the pure flavicol powder — i bet that’d be incredible,positive
has anyone mentioned that this bbq sauce looks fantastic will you tell us how you made it guga,positive
hey guga we know that dry brining steak is actually good so what if try dry aged steak using garlic powder and black pepper and lets see if it will work and will taste much better ,positive
popcorn oil is amazing i used to work at a movie theater and we’d pop the kernels by adding one pump of oil into the hopper one day i added a second pump of oil and the popcorn was amazing perfect golden color savory delicious people complimented how good the popcorn was i became the guy responsible for making all the popcorn one day i showed a coworker my secret and he thought “if 2 pumps of oil is better than 1 then 6 must be amazing” we received so many complaints over his oily popcorn had to throw the whole batch out in giant garbage bags the lesson a little oil goes a long way don’t overdo it with that stuff ,positive
the juxtaposition between angel and leos reactions is hilarious leo the juices themselves you get from the steak are creamier its a little bit more savory its a little bit rich whatever you did to it enhanced the flavors of the steak and made it an overall better experience i love this angel the second one had a urgh you know like its like urgh its like urgh you know its like uurrgh,positive
a thought hit me recently we need a guga meatloaf i can just imagine how amazing that would be whether with waygu or regular beef i think it would be an awesome experiment,positive

in ww2 when the americans liberated the concentration camp saintcyprien located in france the american troops wanted to feed the newly freed camp prisoners because they have been starving without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food literally seconds after liberating them the soldiers thinking it was the right thing started giving the prisoners apples sandwiches and even chocolates leading to a lot of prisoners dying after that incident the science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the medical staff feed them first it was mostly a slow input of light soup,negative
the fact that jimmy talked about refeeding syndrome and had a bunch of medical experts on standby really shows the precautions he takes behind the scenes hes really serious about doing these challenges and definitely should be taken inspiration for a lot of people,positive
there’s a story on youtube about a crew of japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food they were eventually rescued by an american ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate making sure they only ate small amounts of soup ship captains in the 1800’s clearly knew how to deal with starvation and it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost,negative
one could say gordans food is to die for,negative
my grandmother told me this story were from the philippines and during the end of wwii during and at the exit of the japanese occupation the us military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food one of my grandmothers neighbors a young boy picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies he dropped dead moments after at the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome,negative
i just feel the need to say as someone diagnosed with anorexia nervosa i appreciate you mat for bringing light to the dangers and science of them,positive
1315 just a quick correction there jimmy did do it for the content but he stated in the comments it was also because he has crohns disease which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation he wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation,negative
i was in a pretty bad accident when i was younger spent about 3 weeks in icu hooked up to a nutrients iv and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed i still remember the first time i tried to eat solid food after that it was a little microwave kraft dinner cup i took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed i havent really been able to eat plain kd since then,negative
this is probably my favourite food theory video to date this information could save lives of people who fast whether voluntarily or not as someone who has unfortunately been in a position of not being able to acquire food i really appreciate this information there had been times in which i went a few days without food only to try and stuff myself i only ever felt sick and knowing its my bodys natural response is a huge perspective change,positive

looks great the bakery where i work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins for dairy we use sour cream rather than milkbuttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla but otherwise very similar someone has maybe already commented this but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo,positive
i’m upset about other things in my life and i’m still confident that i would love these and not complain about blueberry placement,positive
perfect timing we have two blueberry bushes that give us about 2 gallons of blueberries every summer tomorrow the picking begins and will continue for at least two weeks cant wait to try this recipe,positive
this looks so delicious cant wait to try it,positive
ive heard a good way to keep berries from sinking is to coat lightly in flour before adding them into the batter,positive
i call the sweet style cornbread breakfast cornbread cause when its paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee it makes a great breakfast im gonna try adding blueberries to my next batch,positive
looks delicious ive got a recipe for strawberry cornmeal cake and i add the strawberries last and gently swirl them into the batter thats already in the pan to keep them suspended incake that being said i also love cobbler so i dont have a problem with blue bottom cornbread either,positive
im really impressed by how clean your oven looks and of course your blueberry cornbread which looks heavenly cant wait to try this recipe,positive
when he said his family couldnt afford the drinks in a packet when he was a kid and now hes travelling all over the world and has everything he likes i felt so good you have come a long way mikey cheers to you,positive
omg yesss another 7 eleven vid these are my fave,positive

living in the uk i’m always envious when i see these kind of convenience store videos i would love that amount of choice in a store near me ,positive
i originally started watching your channel because of your 7 eleven vending machine japan episodes so happy to see more 7 eleven content i don’t know why but they fascinate me,positive
mike enjoying korean convenience store food more than disney usa… priceless,positive
i always come to your channel when im having a bad anxiety ridden day it helps me relax and its truly entertaining thank you ,positive

i love the fact that hes so respectful and willing to be open minded on others cultures ,positive
great video as always you make 20 minutes seem like 5 minutes by being so entertaining and informative,positive
it really rubs me the wrong way when people try and serve something they won’t even eat no need to be sensational suny you always do such an amazing job dealing with all types of situations you find yourself in great video,positive
when my youngest sister was about a month or so away from having her first child i told her that the hospital takes the placenta and will make something like spaghetti or lasagna and thats the first meal after her baby was born she kinda freaked out when they brought her a bowl of spaghetti im such a mean brother ,negative
nothing sonny tries shocks me anymore lol i mean drinking raw blood and eating a fish alive great content as usual,positive
its really interesting that you said that placentas texture is very mushroomlike because theres a really good manga that featured evil babies that grew out their placentas into fake mushrooms so they could mind control the hospital staff by feeding them the placentashrooms makes you wonder if junji ito ate placenta before,positive
in my hometown in việt nam when i was a child we raised cows and we also ate placenta it was not an everyday treat and in my opinion it is a delicious delicacy so fascinating to see some thai folks enjoy it as well,positive
with the combination of animals organs countries and styles of cooking i love how sonny would never run out of content like this ,positive
i love how you can put a literal 3 feet tall stick in a freezer at home,positive
the watermelon jello looks so delicious ,positive

i had the pleasure of meeting calvin in person while in vietnam 2 weeks ago he was eating and drinking with us and he’s definitely a down to earth person with a humorous personality it would be awesome to meet sonny one day too ,positive
i never thought id type this sentence but as someone with a fear of snakes id actually try the snake intestine noodle dish this was really interesting thank you as always for the great content and calvin is awesome,positive
i just love how sonny and calvin are just having a casual food conversation after the snake went and did its business all over sonnys shirt,positive
i love calvin as a cohost i dont think hes done an episode with sonny without using the word gelatinous,positive
i love how the family eats together ,positive

today i made fried food with cheetos would it be delicious to make food with snacks i thought it would be really bad but there was a huge twist it was so delicious and the color was so cool especially it was really delicious when i fried snacks on rice cakes it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside i want to eat again you should try making it too thank you for watching my video 今日はチートスのお菓子で揚げ物料理を作ってみました！ お菓子で食べ物を作るなんて···。 非常にまずいようだったがとてつもない反転がありました とてもおいしくて 色もとてもきれいな食べ物でした 特にお餅にお菓子をつけて揚げて食べたから本当に美味しかったです。 外側はさくさくで、内側はしっとり！ また食べたい！ 皆さんも作ってみてください！ 僕の映像を見てくださって、 ありがとうございます。 오늘은 치토스 과자로 튀김 요리를 만들어봤어요 과자로 음식을 만든다니 아주 맛이 없을 것 같았는데 엄청난 반전이 있었어요 너무 맛있고 색감도 좋았어요 특히나 전에 뽑아뒀던 가래떡에 튀긴게 신의 한수였는데 겉은 바삭하고 속은 촉촉한게 아주 별미였습니다 또 먹고싶다 여러분도 만들어보세요 제 영상 봐주셔서 감사합니다,positive

no foodie beauty is a horrible human,negative
the amount of effort you put into each and every video is so awesome i love your vids,positive
foodie beauty is actually a terrible person … and context behind that video is her “cheat meal” was at 5am while her boyfriend at the time got woken up by her and had to get ready she had eaten a salad and cottage cheese the night before i believe and while yes she ate it it wasn’t fulfilling so she at this prebreakfast she genuinely is vile iykyk,negative
we filipinos eat with our hands on some occasions and if we know how because not everyone does but there are limitations in what we can eat with our hands the idea of mushing mac and cheese between my fingers already make me squirm and it feels so wrong its like using chopsticks on spaghetti,negative

love when you talk about you glad you are feeling a little better in yourself we all have our inner demons people who want to judge and bully say more about themselves than they do about you you are a sweet lady like i said i love hearing your stories i tell myself all the time get a grip of yourself i must do this i must do that when you are stuck at home all by yourself it’s hard to motivate f the negative comments you don’t need them i’m sure there are more love than hate stay awesome,positive

ah yes my young lord boruto proving minatos genes were passed to him how he used his vanishing rasengan so fast and still met up to hit that backflip and dodge saradas chidori tooo beautiful… and my goat momo ugh,positive
sarada using chidori is one of the best scenes in all boruto universe aaaaaaaaaaa,positive
i can’t even express or explain how legendary and outstanding the voice actor for thorfinn was in this episode that scream holy shit reminded me of erens screams in attack on titan definitely one of my favorite moments of anime so far it’s literally his origin story now i’m wondering if askeladd really wanted thors to be the leader was that laugh a change within the moment i’m not sure but wow what an episode  full uncut reaction to this reaction every reaction i upload on my patreon ,positive
the sad part is when askellad asked thors to be their leader he was actually serious but as he realized it was impossible he had to laugh it off to save face in front of his men,negative
this show is about to pick up and you’re gonna love these characters more and more as it goes nick,positive
thorfinn screaming his lungs out saying he’s going to kill them gives me the biggest chills because you can hear all the pain in his voice but at the same time you can hear how serious he is  i can’t want to see how he will accomplish this ,negative
a true warrior doesnt need a sword thors the troll one of the best lines in the series,positive
such a good episode thorfinn’s voice reached all of us man,positive
great reaction askeladd was actually serious about having thors becoming their leader but he said he was joking when he saw the disapproval on his face,positive
thorfinns scream gets me every time the amount of emotion that was put into it just blew me away,positive
season 1 of vinland saga is one of the best first seasons of anime ever and season 2 coming out in the beginning of next year is going to be even better truly excited to see your upcoming reactions for this masterpiece of a tale,positive
now this is a try not to laugh challenge actually funny clips one after another after another tyrone straining and struggling not to laugh a real ab workout,positive
i dont always agree with them but they are hilarious,positive
i didn’t even try i just needed a good laugh today and this was perfect,positive
i only lost cause tyrone was looking like his whole face was gonna explode holding that in,negative
their faces its so funny to see 2 buffed up dudes talking like that and just joking around,positive
this was hard but i made it kevin saying supplement wrong numerous times took everything from me idk why that part was so funny to me,positive
i have a 22 year old son he has had two falling outs in his life both times they cussed each other took a little time apart and eventually made up and became bros again i have a 17 year old daughter ive lost count of her falling outs and those girls are dead to her half the women my wife considers friends she comes home from hanging out with them and just rags them to obliteration to me,negative
as a male rn who worked with almost all women bill is right on,positive
we brought you into this world nope my mother did and i respect her for this but i refuse to respect someone based on their gender or race or anything else other than your behaviour and character,negative
speaking only from my experience as a 40 year old man most of the guys i knew in highschool are all still friends pretty much all the girls hate each other two women will stare daggers at each other because the other one wore the same color as her two guys can get into a fist fight and if the right song comes on the jukebox they become best friends and spend the rest of the night drinking and talking about music,negative
i am grateful for the woman that brought me into this world not only that she loved me and supported me in ways no one would she went above and beyond while others have been one disappointment after another i owe her everything and i help her out whenever she asked but the thing is only one woman brought me into this world and that credit does not roll over to the rest of the gender,positive
okay this gonna be a long one sorry about that im french and theres an interesting fact about france its that we are brutally honest most other people dont like that so we are called arrogant rude obnoxious but we are not we are just honest and people dont like honesty when we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other its not because we cheat more than you its just because we honestly answered the questions youre probably wondering where im going with that well i was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other not staying friends with each other yadayadayada and i cant relate at all because it doesnt work like that here i still know a lot of female who were already friend in high school and im 40 whenever i see my mother or my girlfriend or my girl friends they are just friendly i dunno its probably only on screen but the number of time i saw in tv shows or movies a group of girls being friendly then as soon as one leave they all turn to bitch on this one thats something i never saw in france they bitch on her while she is here and she doesnt take it badly because she does the same so i was wondering why is that why are they still friends if its different for others then i realized because we are honest my female friends wont hesitate to look at each others and say wow girl you look like shit today didnt you put on weight recently maybe you should work out and for me thats a healthy relationship why does american males manage to stay friends because they trash talk each other because they are honest because they say things as they are yeah sometimes we have fallouts but we mend things why cant female american stay friends because they are sneaky they lie ooooh you look gorgeous girl you are so strong i envy you while not thinking any of that sooner or later in any relationship based on lie the truth will come out and its not going to be pretty,negative
it was super difficult to mashup this whole fight 5 parts searching for all the parts in the anime it was difficult but enjoyed it hope you guys would enjoy too part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 dont forget my backup channel enjoy,positive
more than a thousand chapters and for me it is still the most dramatic luffy fight in no other have i felt that it has had to be pushed to the limit as in this one,positive
so glad usopp returned for this part of the arc tho we never got an explanation to where sogeking went,positive
definitely one of luffys toughest opponents ever seeing that luccis fighting skills were superior than his pretimeskip,positive
when i first watched this i was so hyped up i was cheering for luffy to win i felt nervous and also i felt like i was there in a way,positive
the ussop moment before the finisher really made this the best main villian finisher in the series so much better than the laido finisher,positive
thank you so much for letting us relive this epicness ,positive
god i love the feeling i get from this anime once it has my 100 attention i live for these moments  shg4l,positive
still the best fight of the series to date and that pop of the gatling is still the most satisfying sound in the show,positive
still one of my top 3 fights of one piece,positive
i love dave chappelle for getting the real truth out there with comedy,positive
this is true dark humor love this man,positive
i have watched all of dave’s standups multiple times he is so funny i can’t get enough ,positive
ive seen about 20 reactions to this but asias was my favorite love this channel keep it up,positive
dave is such a comedic genius,positive
omg chapelle is the greatest great reaction,positive
sticks and stones is great from beginning to end if you havent seen it you should jump on netflix tonight ,positive

asia’s waving the white flags in “rapid fire” mode at the end ,positive

hey guys can you check out “memu aagamu” the new coke studio track it’s an indiankpop collab featuring allu arjun you will love it for sure ,positive
please react on memu agamu ft allu arjun song ,positive
please react to mv memu aagamu ft allu arjun armaan malik and tribe youll love it when you see it,positive
this one also looks promising because the directors are same and hrithik looks fine as always also excited because the bgm is done by sam cs who is an underrated music director who composed music for the original vikram vedha will need to check the songs done by vishalshekhar who are also good music directors excited for the trailer,positive
the tamil one sethupathi gave a more calmer yet menacing version of vedha whereas hrithik here seems to be out and out brutal really eager to see how good he has been throughout the entire movie,positive
ive watched original vikram vedha tamil and honestly i just loved vijay setupathi as vedha and his mannerisms but i would love to see hrithik as vedha ,positive
gave me goosebump at the last hearing the original bgm ,positive
this got me so hyped especially hrithik being the highlight for me also the it factor for me was to see such a diverse talented cast and the bgm as well achara saying that it wasnt convincing actually makes me believe that shes just still adjusting to seeing hrithik in a negative role because those eyes stood out for me giving that maniac sadistic vibe that it was supposed to and the background setting of imambara from lucknow though,positive
despite being a remake everyone is excited and going to support this film because of its outstanding starcast their performances is going to be fire  especially of hrithik he never disappoints always tries to bring something different to the audience,positive
tamil is a tremendous success may they get that success or more in hindi too looking at the casting there is hope and so are the directors the end bgm is ,positive
while everyone is appreciating greek godlets take a moment to appreciate saif as well this man is definition of diverse roles from playing funny goofy college guys to playing intense roles like sartaj udaybhan in tanhaji and vikram he proved that atleast one major khan in industry works in realistic cinema as well he also have maintained his physique and look at such age definitely deserves appreciation,positive
sorry about the bland background everyone we will back to our original space for episode 4 hope you guys liked our reactions ,positive
it’s ok don’t worry about the background im glad my favourite youtubers are doing their reaction ,positive
the brides father in this is in a ton of dramas hes really good at playing harsh grandfather or ceo types usually if hes in a drama i watch it,positive
im gonna become your patreon just because this show and those hats i love you guys,positive
her dad was being sarcastic in the most compassionate way when she brought him seaweed sushi from the expensive restaurant like she had the option to bring him literally anything else from a place thats 300k per meal and she brings something similar to what he spends all day making its like bringing a sandwich shop owner a sandwich with fancier ingredients but from woo young woos perspective gimbapseaweed sushi is her favorite thing so it was a gift of love for her dad,positive
they fell in love with the lawyer with the wedding dress and that smile,positive
this movie was tricky with the amount of swearing in it youtube kept restricting it as 18 and blocked in some countriesterritories so i had to mute all the f words so that everyone can have access to the video,negative
its so cute that dasha was so happy when she was able to pronounce thriller,positive
as insane as walter is he was correct about the kidnappers being amateurs and the toe belonging to someone else,negative
the coen brothers are two of the greatest american directors i iike all of their films but as others have suggested “fargo” and “raising arizona” are essential films to see,positive
the fact that walter practically causes half the film’s problems yet it turns out in the end not to mention for all for the wrong reasons he was right about everything,negative
this film becomes much more enjoyable as you watch it several times,positive
for how overthetop walter is he is a lovable character,positive
having enjoyed two of the coen brothers movies you should probably watch a few more i think fargo is probably the one i would recommend most raising arizona o brother where art thou and true grit would probably also be on the short list for followup movies,positive
julianne moore is an excellent actress here playing an artist who wants to be a single mother,positive
true story and sad about val kilmer having throat cancer and pretty much unable to act again and tom cruise fought to have val kilmer to be in the film writing in his condition and his appearance in the film was absolutely beautiful,positive
3848 a sequel that deserves and gets a wonderful reaction from mish ellie the final half hour of this is a real emotional wringer no matter what – but it’s especially intense and all the more adrenalinfilled if like mish ellie you’ve seen the first film already,positive
michelle its a privilege to fly with maverick ellie tell that to his dad legit spat tea choked at that one re mavs f18 being unable to fly again after his demo pulling gs damages the structure of aircraft too many gs will break the airframe immediately but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage microscopic cracks that build up over time invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks sometimes during normal nonextreme flying to combat this all aircraft have a rated glife that is the maximum cumulative number of gs they can pull in their lives before theyre retired as a precautionary measure mavs extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his f18 immediately but they may have used up so much of its glife that its effectively scrap anyway,negative
its really cool to compare the leap in cinematography when it comes to filming the action with the fighters in the 80s it was amazing but now it looks pretty calm and the shots in this movie taken from inside and outside the planes are amazing,positive
ive been waiting for this one since you did the first im so conflicted i spent most of my life using top gun as an example that not all great movies need a sequel then the bastards made one and then they added insult to injury by making it so fucking good lol,negative
its the best action movie seen all year and its understandable why tom cruise went out of his way to get this movie seen in theaters that feeling of watching a movie and feeling all the adrenaline was almost gone good reaction girls,positive
ellie loves goose a lot few times goose was shown through flashbacks or mentioned she was emotional,positive
one of the best movies ive ever seen honestly i wasnt even a big fan of the first top gun so i had no expectations with this one but it blew me away,positive
y’all know that jr and kane clip made my day,positive
kane had some of the best returns in his career the pops that he got were ridiculously unreal they shouldve given kane more world championships than they did,positive
the way bischoff sold and got hit with edgrs spear honestly looks like he died especially when it looked like he hit his head on the bottom turnbuckle,negative
kinda sad that cenas return at mitb wasnt on here but it was still a great video none the less,positive
jr going wild when cena returned in the royal rumble made the moment even more epic and iconic,positive
my 1 would have been cena returning at mitb last year hearing cole sound like joey styles when cena came out was hilarious,positive
sting returning at wm 31 and rock returning at 2012 on raw was litrerly the loudest pop and commentators were absolutely going wild,positive
matt smith portrayal of daemon targaryen was nothing short of perfection he plays the character the way i imagined he would be in a live action format cant wait for yah to see more of him also ladies this show is about the dance of dragons so yah wont be seeing the mad king in this show,positive
matt smith is another example of dont judge a casting until you see them in the role because i was like bruh they got dr who to play one of the most badass characters in the history of westeros then i saw this episode and was highly impressed,positive
i liked that they showed daemon crying at the funeral they took great effort to show how antagonistic he is but then showed us he clearly loves his family,positive
as a fan of grrm and reading all materials associated with this story i must agree with george dameon targaryen is my favorite characters within these histories definitely top two i ride with dameon lololol get ready for a ride,positive
ned stark would have never ever sent one of his daughters to do foolishness like that and it makes me miss him yet again,negative
ladies daemon targaryen is george martins favorite character in all books hes written this show will be fun with him being the instigator,positive
your guys reaction is everything this is gonna be a fun series to follow ur reactions on i can’t wait y’all had me rolling  so much shock and awe  this show had me hooke within minutes so nice to be back ,positive
514 dreams are extremely important to targaryens the reason they were able to escape the doom of valyria is because a targaryen girl dreamed of the doom and was able to warn her family,positive
so much practice and talent,positive
nice,positive
increíble baile me encanta las cuatro son unas reinas lisa la mejor  jenlisa ,positive

nossa este dance pratice tá incrível amei a coreografia  pink venom,positive
they never disappoint proud of them all blackpink is really the revulotion they are purr but blinks please keep attention for spotify please stream and listen there too,positive
my theory here that plant creature could possibly be that fungus but in a more mutated form as seen previously in the missing persons and autopsy report videos whenever someone dies in the backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus this fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate 100 1000 or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the informational video with the date 291990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel that researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the presentation video with the date 581990 when the alarm rang out and cctv footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by async so by this logic the whenever someone dies in the backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time the creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash as seen in kanes secret video of 9780415263573 this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage the driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there the fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form also it sounded like the creature was yelling out help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver its all just a theory which i just came up with dont take it canon lol,negative
speaking about backrooms you definitely should check out the complex found footage free game on steam its heavily inspired by kane pixels version and nails the vibe,positive
kane has proven without a doubt that he truly has serious talent when it comes to storytelling and world building i can’t wait to see what he has in store for us later down the line glad to see you’re still keeping up with the series ryan,positive
lucky that steel energy card wasnt very old some collectors would be having a mental breakdown if it was also love to see u got pokemon cards too and love to see more backrooms content,positive
the humor and jokes of ryan is just top tier easily one of the best comedic gaming youtubers,positive
imagine all the friends and family who went missing without a trace ended up in the backrooms,negative
1203 i agree with ryan the sound design is on point animations world building too kane pixels is a very talented 17 year old person,positive
no sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular i saw this opening night in imax and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life the sound of the jets flying by the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the g forces kick in and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots i legitimately believed during the final dogfight that maverick was going to die so few movies today make me believe that on top of all that the story is so freaking amazing the theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones the story of rooster learning to not just forgive maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and “don’t think just fly” and of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when maverick visits iceman even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance thank you tom cruise for fighting so hard to get this movie in theaters,positive
tom cruise is truly the embodiment of megastardom one of the best films in decades,positive
i love how hangman could’ve been a typical cliche bad guy and he absolutely isn’t he’s cocky and arrogant in top gun because that’s what top gun brings out of young pilots their competitive nature once he’s on the aircraft carrier he is all business encouraging and ready to help i love that,positive
sad that val kilmer iceman has been dealing with throat cancer these last few years you saw him in willow but its beautiful how they wrote his illness into the story and gave his character weight and honor he also played batman once ,positive
spiderman no way home and top gun maverick both brought back the moviegoing experience in huge droves as both films became one of the first films to gross over 1 billion worldwide at the box office since the pandemic began also tom cruise and paramount made the right decision delaying this for two years because its a film thats made for the big screen and everyone knows that,positive
1545 val kilmer lost his voice for real due to throat cancer but they used an ai computer program to digitally recreate his voice it was nice to see them bring him onboard for this movie heartwarming and one of the most amazing moments in the film all because tom wanted him to be a part of this movie so much i got to meet val kilmer at a convention a few years ago after he beat cancer but lost his voice he was one the bravest and kindest guys ever,positive
i used to own a betamax similar to vhs tape of top gun many years ago and me and my 2 kids aged 5 and 4 would watch it almost daily now theyre grown up and have their own family and yet we got to watch maverick together at home here in the philippines it was an absolutely amazing sequel and yes we all felt the stress and emotions just as you did magy your reactions were so on point and wonderful to watch thank you,positive
im with you magy i loved this movie and felt it was actually better than the first,positive
fun fact the reason why the f35 fighter that maverick mentions when hes briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the gps jamming in actuality behind the scenes the f35 didnt have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the f18s they needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the f35 couldnt accommodate that,negative
damn really good to see your reaction on indian songs hope you will soon check out the trailer of brahmastra it is really in trending and one of the most anticipated bollywood film of 2022,positive
the fact that people are finally appreciating their talent loveeeee thank you for reacting ,positive

was the asoiaf dream prophecy a bit much or just right we liked it but we have questions and well be discussing it on our livestream this thursday head to and join the bar regular tier to get early and uncut access to our hotd bar commentary and livestream coverage,positive
this show being back in the bar makes me so nostalgic nostalgic we all felt when got was the most hyped show after one episode i am optimistic about house of the dragon and it will be a pleasure to watch these reactions again cheers,positive
the genuine disgust everyone had at otto telling alicent to go to the king and give him comfort while wearing one of her mothers dresses is everything i think daemon is going to be a standout character thanks to matt smiths nuance portrayal of him i loved smiths delivery and daemons blunt acknowledgement of the truths viserys cant bear to face as ever thank you so much for sharing your reactions looking forward to the season to come,positive
poor viserys hes a good dude but he suffers the human flaw that almost everyone suffers hes adverse to hearing harsh truths about himself even from his own brother,negative
when viserys was talking about the winter coming danys theme was also playing it was so sad ,negative
que nostálgico ver sus reacciones me acuerdo que esperaba después de cada episodio la reacción del bar faltó gente pero sigue siendo el mismo placer saludo desde argentina de un fan de got que los conoció gracias a la serie ,positive
i love how we never heard daemon say “the heir for a day”,positive
green haired girl is back and giggly as ever lol she’s dope though my guy shaggy is by her side of course al roker jr is trying to be a scene stealer he’s bringing all the sass john cena to his left is completely unbothered david spade is behind them for support hagrid and chris evans have new seats this is great sean,positive
such a good feeling seeing you guys back at the bar watching game of thrones this just feels right,positive
targaryans have prophetic dreams called dragon dreams however as maester aemon said i see them in my dreams sam i see a red star bleeding in the sky i still remember red i see their shadows on the snow hear the crack of leathern wings feel their hot breath my brothers dreamed of dragons too and their dreams killed them every one the grief and glory of house targaryen,negative
daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in fire and blood the “heir for a day” brothel scene really makes me question him we saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the gold cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys mysaria seems to be an enabling force goading him into his darker tendencies when he says “we must all grieve in our own ways” i think he actually was somewhat saddened by baelon’s and aemma’s death daemon does want power but he does love his brother “over the centuries house targaryen has produced both great men and monsters prince daemon was both in his day there was not a man so admired so beloved and so reviled in all westeros he was made of light and darkness in equal parts to some he was a hero to others the blackest of villains” archmaester gyldayn,negative
absolutely in love with this new show already loved all the actors and rhaenyras dracarys was absolutely amazing,positive
that childbirth scene was gruesome the screams affected me just as much as shireen’s burning at the stake,negative
targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams the only reasons the house survived the doom of valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to dragonstone even in game of thrones dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs thats why she did it this is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all,negative
my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,negative
existem cantores bons ótimos excelentes e existe dimash simplesmente incrível um grande abraço do brasil ,positive
this avemaria composed by igor krutoy sang by dimash as you see this song is amazing ,positive
the composer of this is the piano player igor krutoy he came out of semiretirement to work with dimash he has composed for people like lara fabian and andrea bocelli  igor wrote a post about this song on his ig one evening about three months before the new wave dimash called me and asked if i could write ave maria for him explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style coincidentally i had a free evening and i gladly sat down at the piano and remembering the italian formula of responsibility worked with inspiration until i achieved the desired result after taking a few days for the composition to rest in my ears soul and heart i sent it to dimash who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear and of course the reception and applause given to dimash by the audience at the new wave show what a happiness it is to do what i love to write for such a genius singer to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand just a short essay on what is happiness,positive
me dio risa cuando estaban hablando y riéndose antes de que dimash abriera la boca y emitiera el primer sonido se quedaron mudos esta es la capacidad que tiene dimash de cautivar al público sin decir una sola palabra es maravilloso esta es una composición de igor krutoy especialmente para dimash no tiene letra para que las personas de cualquier credo puedan disfrutarla y vaya que lo logra gracias por su sincera admiración al magnifico dimash ,positive
this vocalise of ave maria was composed by igor krutoy especially for dimash it goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional songs is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as dimash the greatest vocalist i have ever heard in my 80 years on this planet and ive heard some really great singers along the way and in every genre ever conceived what a blessing to experience this voice this incomparable talent btw very nice reaction,positive
unbelievable recently filmed in germany titled the innovators featuring 5 young adults from around the world who have turned their industries on their heads and impacted them forever opens with dimash qudaibergen at 28 is changing the face of todays music worldwide widely considered a music and business genius sole head and decision maker of his production company its state of the art on a campus of studios stage warehouses conference and creative centers and administration buildings and produces every aspect of his career in house from films videos albums to concerts tickets sales and distribution of merchandise pr marketing administration legal and more surrounds himself with world class talent in every field hands on and laser focused the only operation of its kind globally no air date yet,positive
i dont care what anyone says about it or how its not comic accurate i absolutely adore this movie,positive
such a shame we havent got a sequel of this movie keanu its a really good fit for the character,positive
also loved the portrayal of lucifer al pacino did his cool version of him around this time too but stormare blew him away,positive
i would really like to see a sequel to the movie with keanu reeves coming back as the titular character and guillermo del toro directing this was back in 20182019 but with their busy schedules looks like we might have to wait a little while longer,positive
yay this movie is underrated imo so glad you’re seeing it i’m sad keanu couldn’t get it rolling as a franchise,positive
this was a great movie on its own and wouldve been great as a standalone series shame it didnt get a sequel but i like it as it is as well i know some people dont like it because of it not reflecting the comics character as much but i say it was a very good version of it,positive
i really like tilda swinton in this movie and even though a lot of people didn’t like it when it came out i did i’m glad you’re watching it now greg good stuff,positive
i still think this movie is visually stunning for the time that it was made every shot and all the cgi and practical effects look so amazing in this movie,positive

hrithik once said “giving d audience same thing what they’ve seen is redundant give them something more a little more” n he gave us a lottt more we fans r loving him he’s d most versatile n all rounder actor in bollywood perfect blend of everything,positive
ive just recently watched the original but ive to say that this teaser actually looks really good im not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but ive high hopes from this film because its the same duo who directed the original one personally i dont have any problems from a remake and i dont think remaking something is a crime the remake however has to be good if it doesnt justify the acting of the original actors then its a crime otherwise if its a remake like kabir singh which is a really good remake then i dont have any problems and i feel this remake will be genuinely good,positive
vijay sir has his own charm  and hr has his own  please dont compare both are legends ,positive
the intro was so good this time you guys somehow always manage to outdo yourself each time loving how you hype hrithik always worth watching your admiration for the right things in bollywood in your reactions,positive
agneepath is the movie you need to watch also langda tyagi character in omkara actually changed saifs persona as an actor,positive
brilliant teaser perfect remake movie may go beyond it since same directors would have streamlined script filling the donts moving to the fact of you guys so you havent watched vikram vedha original and going to love this movie upto your choice yet thats hypocrisy,positive
i am tamil i love the rmadhavanvjs movie by watching this we might get more footages and backstory that we missed in the tamil version and wow hrithiks craziness is awesome ,positive
hrithik is a terrific actor u cant deny ,positive

so enjoyable and so funny video,positive
watching doflamingo’s speech after reverie is even crazier ,negative
this was extremely enjoyable notice how we didnt have rob talking shit about zoro i hope reactions can be like this from now on,positive
its worth noting that laws plan was to destroy the smile factory to get kaido mad at doflamingo so doflamingo and kaido would end up fighting each other taking down doflamingo themselves wasnt part of the plan,negative
remember at the beginning when it was luffy a lone pirate with his small boat and a green hair bounty hunter who uses three swords that was tied to a pole ohh how one piece has come a long way,positive

luffy doesnt just have 5600 people under him he also has supporters from all the places he been from alabasta skypiea fishman island and etc he has allies everywhere  our boys making it to the big leagues,positive
i have watched vikram vedha on youtube in hindi last year i dont think saif can beat r madhwan in acting r madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie but saif doesnt look innocent at all throughout the trailer r madhwans smile was enough to make vikram vedha a thriller movie,positive
vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor i have seen in south industry n r madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece,positive
krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster ,positive
sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,negative
i always wonder why his videos are never in trending they are so hilarious yet to the point,positive
everyone is busy praising this moviebut i prefer the original anytimeno comparison therebut your reviews are as usual hilarious,positive

1932 thats what you got from daemons smile how are everyone giving daemon villain tag so quickly it feels like i saw some other episode and many other people saw another it felt more like my brother knows me hes right these other idiots know nothing smile daemon is vicious and acts douchy but also cares about his family from the scenes before with rhaenyra at the funeral,negative
i actually loved daemon he seems to actually love his family as soon as the king said why would i do that about not making him his handdaemons immediate answer was cause i’m your brotherit didn’t sound like it was a birth right thing but that he was actually hurt his brother didn’t choose him and he’s for sure not wrong the console is playing him they see his weakness and you can afford to show weakness as a leader it’s a fact,positive
so excited you guys are reacting to this can’t wait to start this journey with you both ,positive
after the foul taste the original got left in my mouth i didnt have very high hopes for this yet i watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons maybe not quite there yet but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it i find it hard to pinpoint daemon on the one hand he wants to show strength the city watch part but then hes also arrogant the tournament claiming victory while the fight wasnt over and straight up horrible heir for a day but on the other hand he really cares for rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her her father would need him more now than ever before which shows he also cares for viserys i think him calling viserys weak was his blunt way of telling viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king which is in line with what he did with the city watch he feels like the king should show his strength viserys seems like hes held things together for those 9 years but this clearly is coming to an end i feel like hes made a huge mistake by alienating daemon this wont make things easy for rhaenyra who already has to fight the fact that some people dont want a woman on the throne in the end i think it will be between those two and viserys will be long gone from the picture,negative
pretty sure that daemon didnt actually say the heir for a day even in the books its implied that otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers and daemon just didnt want to say anything at that moment he is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure,negative

casting is looking perfect but it would be more enjoyable if we didnt know the story bcoz the original vedha was unpredictable and this time we know each and every move of him,positive
i think we should give this movie a chance because hritik has never disappointed us in acting from blind to teacher from theive to secret agent his acting was always on point,positive
don’t care if it is a remake or not if hrithik roshan is in it ,positive
when hrithik says iss baar sirf majah hi nahi tajub bhi hoga at the starting of the teaser makes me feel that there some surprise for the audience or change in the story im too excited for it,positive
i dont care even if its a remake because i havent seen the original one and it seems like it would be a good upgraded remake so looking forward ,positive
i have high expectations in this film the trailer is soo much exciting,positive

the best part about the teaser is that both hrithik and saif look drastically different from r madhavan and vijay sethupathi and very honestly hrithiks vedha is looking slightly more menacing than vijays im cautious but highly excited at the same time im quite hopeful towards this movie coz the directors of the original have made this as well and if im not wrong theyve said it isnt a scene to scene remake hopefully optimistic ,positive
i’m from chennai but i’m a big fan of hrithik and don’t tell me it’s a remake it’s a beautiful script which is worth to be filmed again  and i’m glad hrithik is doing the villain role,positive
i respect to everyone who wear involved in seriously the best piece that ve every seen on youtube hats off to well all i love your video ,positive
hrithik is next level no one can beat him  he not copy vijay setupati he played his character in own swag  the king of indian cinema hr ,positive
you should watch the original movie featuring r madhavan and vijay sethupati its a masterpiece ,positive
first time after a long time after kabir singh this look promising i watched original i dont want to know about story line i just want to see the maniac and dense acting of these two,positive
its directed by original director so hell yeah im gonna watch it,positive
i love the original tamil movie the tamil version solidified vijay sethupathy as my favorite actor the whole concept of setting up the story in the vikram vetal backdrop was so unique the climax fight vedha has a come what may unhinged chaotic attitude and the crazy banter between vikram and vedha during the fight it was absolutely fresh to look at personally i love both saif and hrithik i really dont want to compare vjs and hrithik ill be honest i was skeptical about the remake but the teaser does look promising i love hrithiks attempt at being the unhinged vedha except for the accent as you rightly pointed out the teaser does look promising even though the bgm is very good i was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head i do miss it i really really really hope and pray this movie does well,positive
theres this eccentricity in hrithiks eyes that tells me hell do full justice to this role he has his own unique style and wont be just mimicking vijay sethupathy i have faith in this movie because of the makers really looking forward to it people just have to approach it with an open mind rather than being so negative even before the release,positive
the only thing thats exciting me in this film is hrithiks portrayal of a gray shaded character hrithik roshan mostly cuz the guy is just so good but in these kind of roles it always just fascinates me to watch one of my favorite actors to perform,positive
that sam cs bgm towards the end gave me massive goosebumps vishalshekar and sam are gonna kill with the soundtrack,positive
initially when i heard that hrithik roshan is playing role of veda i doubted if he could fit into that role which vijay sethu pathi immortalized that characterafter watching the teaser i am surprised and excited to see veda in this remake version congratulations to both heroes hrithik roshan and ofcourse vikram role is tailor made for saif ali khan,positive
fully agree with you regarding that scene where vedha hrithik is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets people have the habit of complaining and most of the people who are complaining they have not even watched the original vv and yes hrithik did not copy amitabh and similarly here he did not copy the great vs,negative
in orginal movie and trailer specifically both vikram and vedha were projected to be equals given equal screen time dialogues and actions but here i believe hrithik is being pushed more than saif and thats what bugs me,negative
ive just recently watched the original but ive to say that this teaser actually looks really good im not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but ive high hopes from this film because its the same duo who directed the original one personally i dont have any problems from a remake and i dont think remaking something is a crime the remake however has to be good if it doesnt justify the acting of the original actors then its a crime otherwise if its a remake like kabir singh which is a really good remake then i dont have any problems and i feel this remake will be genuinely good,positive
let me clear you that if you are watching this song without watching movie then its not worthy and you will not understand the reason of this songss rajamouliall time hit movies provider,negative
ram charan dances sooo well but jr ntr debuted as protagonist when he was 18 years old but ram charan came later both actors age is similar like rc is 37 and jrntr is 39 both are good friends off the camera as well btw ram charan is son of mega star chiranjeevi who is a very very good dancer as well so obviously his son would dance good as well,positive
now please react to nachore nachore song of jr ntr yamadonga movie ss rajamouli direction sensational dance moves by ntr at the age of 24  in 2007 i bet you wont regret after watching that song,positive
each and every actor in south industry can dance so well,positive
to know ramcharans talent you should watch bangaru kodi petta song from magadeera movie then you will realise how he is capable of,positive
i think sufiyan is slowly becoming fan of ntr  react to more of ntr my suggestion is nachore nachore song from yamadonga movie you guys will definitely love him more,positive
its naatu naatu in original language and jrntr alluarjun ramcharan ram pothineni are the top dancers in telugu film industry,positive
im from india  love ur vids but i really miss anum  in this video,positive
nobody can beat original one ratsasan what a masterpiece,positive
ratsasan is ratsasani mean original is original no one can defeat originial ,positive
this the master piece our indian movie original is always best,positive
ratsasan trailer gives more information of movie scenes except the villain scene and face thats why you were able to guess about disorder and gifts things but cuttputlli trailer just gives few glimpses of ratsasan movie and focused more on akshays dialogue without revealing anything thats the plus point obviously original remains classic but lets see remake works or not,positive
its more complex and confusing than you think its good its made in hindi also great movie wish the remake also live up to that  react to deva deva song from brahmāstra,positive
rathsasan goosebumps this movie need appreciation,positive
you should watch rathsasan movieits indias best thriller movieits also available on youtube in hindi dubbed with the name fo main hu dandadhikariplease watch original one and after watch remake,positive
ratsasan top charter bgm storyline screenplay dialogues performance picturized brilliantly actions cinematography editing sound design spoton class,positive

eminem studied the rappers that came before him and surpassed them a long time ago that shows a genuine love for the art you should react to brainless and bad guy from eminem both are fantastic songs,positive
im a clown like john wayne gacy is one of my favorite things hes ever said,positive
his wordplay metaphors punches and diverse flows are just syncopated genius with any beat em the goat of hip hop forever,positive
please go for tone deaf the bars are hades itself em rhymes orange with banana there its one of my favourites from the album,positive
the real amazing thing about ems first few lines is that he was finishing young ma’s rhyme scheme that she started way back in her verse she rhymes quavo facial lay lo wayne mode drake mode rake mode paid so gang mode pain go flame go etc it’s out of order i know and then em comes in “game oever thanos” and finished it the man is a monster but that was nothing but respect to young ma for holding the rhyme scheme out that long which i think was something she did to pay homage to em cause that’s his style fire song,positive
no one even comes close to em flow cadence story telling accents technicality and beats all fit for what he does he is the greatest rapper by a mile and it aint even close,positive
what other movie scenes shall we react to see if you can find scenes from your favourite movies hopefully less then 10 mins long just send us the names or links below ,positive

this is one of their best choreographies its so awesome the energy the switch and the formation of the choreo and everything is on point and very detailed it also showcases how smooth of a dancer each member is and how they can match the fierce of the song to the swag good job tbh,positive
the hand thing that lisa jennie and jisoo did at rosés part was sooooo satisfying,positive
some haters may say ah the movements are easy peasy it seems they forgot that not everyone can pull out some easy movement into extravagant dance stage presence of yg artists never disappoint me blackpink killed and nailed it like always,positive
their charisma is on another level you can really see how much they grow confident since the last time they preform ,positive
in this dance practice lisa movement really sharp crazy shes the main dancer and yes i love all members too blackpink is the revolution,positive
i cant wait for them to perform it on vmas im actually kinda expecting this dance practice video because literally earlier this day i checked their last comeback on how many days til they release their dance practice and its only 6 days so i expected it to be released today,positive
yg said that title track is going to shake the whole world im so excited for title track,positive
its satisfying to watch everytime lisa dance it just her aura really blow up she knows how to control her body her facial expressions the professional dancer behavior,positive
i get really mesmerize when lisa is dancing her expression and body control is perfect,positive
main dancer lisa coming through way to go bp best choreo,positive
why am i crying seeing this how much struggle has gone in to gain this independence,negative
we have not got freedom for free thousands of known and unknown heroes sacrified their lives to give us freedom my salute to them ,positive
couldnt contain my tears at the jallianwala bagh scene  and the pride you feel when subhash chandra bose appears  goosebumps and when rani lakshmibai fought so bravely  this tribute is just too beautiful ,positive
the number of times i got goose bumps while watching this video is more than while reading this in books wasnt able to control my tears while watching those sacrifices given by our ancestors heads off to all the people who participated in making our country independent jai hind jai bharat,positive
this was amazing we should be proud of our country,positive
this is really an amazing animated video that creates goosebumps and fills every indians heart with pride joy and sadness as well the creator mentioned the name assam but i want to add more names of freedom fighters who are from assam and equally contributed foremost name is kanaklata baruah just a 17 years old girl and she took bullet while hoisting indian flag and died on the spot other freedom fighters are gopinath bordoloi jyoti prasad agarwala maniram dewan kushal konwar hem barua tyagbir bhogeswari phukanani other prominent freedom struggle unsung heroes from northeast india are major paona brajabashi bir tikendrajit singh rani gaidinliu 13 years old naga girl haipou jadonang u tirot sing syiemlieh moje riba u kiang nangbah pa togan sangma and the list of names doesnt stop here there are many more ,positive
lakshya legit killed them with facts love the way hes changing and replying to toxic content creators with such maturity shame on unnatural,negative
basically it was an mistake i was trying to give copyright claim to those who use my content but unintentionally it goes copyright strike to my friend kundan btw i am glad you cover my news,positive
one of the best thing about today that he never text credit for himself when he achieve something  he always respect us the audience and his team and he is always polite in all of his video we congratulation our solve on this achievement more to come and everything to come,positive
lakshay killed it this time all he said was fax,positive
saiman the most underrated you tubr and neon man the most timerated you tuber,negative
one best thing about dude is that whenever he achieves something he never gives the credit to himself he always respect us the audience the most and his team too he is always polite in every of video we congratulate ourselves for this achievement more to come and everything comes we always with you rtzg,positive
masterpieces cannot be recreated they cannot be overshadowed the original was a masterpiece story was mesmerizing taken from the inspirational olden story of king vikram vampire vedha in a different style bgm was outstanding in tamil both vijay madhavan were given an excellent par performance,positive
cant say anything about this now but original one was a master piece thrill suspence was top notch and acting in that by r madhavan and vijay setupati was at their best,positive
i know hrx is good but in the original one vijay setupati n r madhvan performance was insane,positive
1053 let’s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative ,positive
hrithik is next level no one can beat him  he not copy vijay setupati he played the character in his own swag  the king of indian cinema hr ,positive
this movie also available which is dubbed one but best one is original  no one match vijay sethupathi but hritik gaves such a glimpse up ,positive
ohh my god what a teaser definitely this film create a new box office records hrithik sir acting was mind blowing ,positive
nothing can beat original vikram vedha ,positive
yesterday i watched kartikey 2 full of goosebumps ,positive
this is lowkey emotional after everything thats happened everyones back in pretty much the same place,positive
remember when they announced hotd first thought “i’ll definitely watch this series with my favorite bar” and here we are ,positive
cheers to house burlington its so great to see everyone back like old times this was a pretty brutal ep rip queen aemma im right there with the guy taking a shot during well actually im right there with the squire losing it in the background of the joust then i take the shot to calm my nerves and stomach cuz yikes,positive
i was so excited when you announced that the watchers of the bar were returning for house of the dragon im thrilled that the first reaction episode is already out its been so long since we got to see you guys all together again thank you for bringing this back much love from oregon 3,positive
it brings me tremendous joy to see everyone back and this still a thing to us on youtube this is like a reaction reunion thanks for doing this again sean ,positive
i basically watched all of got by myself none of my real life friends cared for the show so i turned to youtube reactions and somehow you guys became my got friends people who i could relate too after each episode thank you for getting the gang back together ,positive
after having a whole pandemic between the ending of got and the beginning of hotd its really wonderful to the see the bar crew having a great time all together in one place,positive
que bueno veros de nuevo ,positive
daemon targaryen aka the rogue prince is the best targaryen in the lore of asoiaf and i cant wait for yah to see more of him an we all should take some time to praise matt smith for his portrayal of the character because its nothing short of perfection the show runners hit it out the park with the casting for all of these characters in this prequel,positive
this brings me back glad to be with the bar again for this ,positive
begin is the song written by rm in jungkooks prespective jungkook shared the feelings he felt with his hyungs and rm made that into a beautiful song lyrics,positive
finally i already missed you so the next one is as soon as possible jungkook and jimin are the ones who get hurt the most they always give more than they expect and often get hard on themselves and often exhaustion and fainting just for everyone to see the best of them in every performance it hurts armys to see him this way,negative
jungkook and jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances they are both the ones i noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering jungkook has gotten injured multiple times hes almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted multiple times or came close to it i of course worry about all the members but i always worry the most for jimin jk because we know how much they would put a performance and entertaining army above their health sometimes,negative
guysill ask again but may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed id really like to see you to react to them as they are important parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history shows how their emotions developed and changed over time and give further context to a specific era episode of the rise of bangtan i hope you dont just brush them aside as its really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like not sure why that changed but i hope youll quickly return to them before it gets too far off its a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well because it gives you a mental break and as i said really just gives you more and more context and content as the series goes on theyll be more and more important to the series too whether thats answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldnt be further explored in the episode itself youve already missed so much content at the very least its be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when its importance hasnt diminished but increased every episode,positive
becoming army truly is a lifechanging experience and one that anyone who hasnt done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand i would have never thought that at the age of 54 i would become such a huge fan and supporter of the boyband my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point 2 years later almost to the day and i look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that 7 young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves they have zero understanding and they all think im crazy i think all i can think is how sad it is that they wont give them a chance and experience the same thing i have i like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is bts you guys are that kind of reactor and its wonderful to see,positive
guys is there a chapter 22 or it ended at 21 jungkook is really hard working and perfectionist he want to go on stage matter what happens to him he is turning 25 very soon  he grew up ,positive
remember all the deleted and bonus episodes a chapter is not actually over until you watch them maybe you didn’t know i really like to watch you react to rise of bangtan but it’s beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you don’t finish a chapter until moving on your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series it’s fair id you don’t this is just so weird sorry,negative
cant wait for episode 14 the rise of bangtan chapter 14 filter,positive
to anybody whos reading this i pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better may the dark thoughts the overthinking and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion may peace and calmness fill your life ,positive

imagine this you wake up in a room that youve never seen before the bed youre lying in is very comfortable you sink right into it you dont want to leave but you want to know where you are you sit up and looking around the room you see that it looks like youre in a very cozy but very old room this room has seen many many things it seems theres a mirror to use in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice there is a closet full of clothes however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you if you prefer the feminine choice it is a beautiful seafoam green dress with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees grouped with black mary janes and long white socks the masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas with black dress shoes you put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room you go down the stairs of the house to find two people they look like blonde twins one is a boy the other is a girl they are sipping their tea when one of them notices you oh youre awake the boy cries so they are the girl replies they introduce themselves as aaron and anastasia aaron tells you that since youve been asleep all morning it would be good for you to go outside with them you reluctantly agree but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside you see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves there are mountains in the distance and you can also see a nice pond in the sky you can see the moons and even a planet or two you can even faintly see the stars there are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings the three of you walk up to that tree and you spend the rest of the day playing there the twins took turns pushing you on the swing eventually night came and you went back to the house for dinner anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta youd ever had and aaron did the dishes insisting that you relax as their guest after a little while you retired to your bedroom changed into the clothes given to you and succumbed to a calm dreamers sleep wondering what the next day had in store for you,positive

i remember two years ago staying up at 3 in the morning with a cup of anxiety just to listen to the 3 am study session premiere at 144p using limited data on my half cracked phone wondering where ill be in the future and if things will go well for me after i graduate now here i am once again at 3 in the morning with a cup of coffee fast internet and my own custom pc it took a lot to get here and i still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future but for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years just know that if i could make it than so can you i hope you will get to experience the same bliss i have at the moment as we often forget to enjoy just today when we keep thinking about the tomorrows and thank you chilledcow for being there during the moments edit i just want to say i appreciate everyone for all the encouraging likes and messages i wish nothing but the best for all of you who are pulling through your struggles,negative

this song never gets old no matter how much i listen i never get bored,positive
i think the fact that a lot of people loved this song before even knowing the lyrics shows how good it is a song that can be enjoyed without having any idea what the lyrics are about is a job done right,positive
a lot of people seem to misinterpret the meaning its saying that you cant leave me even if you want to you cant stay away from me dont deny the fact that even if we should stay away from each other you want me you love me its about a toxic relationship that just wont die because of the raging sexual tension and romance they cant escape from,negative

i love how two male lions express their love and frienship to each other,positive
a very tearful moment for me as the lion was in need of help and the other one come to help then they actually rolled in the grass to celebrate their victory amazing love that has been,positive
the moment polar bear appeared behind the seal and the subsequent chase with long moment of suspension when we know nothing about the outcome is some of the finest nature moment captured on film,positive
the way those first lions celebrated cuddled afterwards was too cute it’s like they said “that was a close call”,positive

this album is 45 year old today and still an absolute banger,positive
this could have been released today and it still would sound futuristic,positive
it’s hard to estimate how many times i’ve listened to this album…it doesn’t really matter but i bought the vinyl in 1977…i was 15 and here it is 01312022 and it’s as fresh as the first time i listened,positive

спасибо за смешную подборку о животных смеялась от души ,positive
i think baby elephants and lion cubs deserved an honorable mention,positive
it was around the summer of 1974 when a friend and i went to the fresno zoo as we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water we watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water needless to say we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother we could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight later that night the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the zoo that day that baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals ive ever seen,positive
i couldnt stop smiling throughout the entire video and my heart just glowed with an aura of golden love thank you so much for making our day brighter by showing all these adorable little darlings if i could id adopt one of each i hope that we humans will work together to save all these species and treat them with love i am so grateful that i was blessed with 7 kitties and one dog throughout my life they were truly a gift from god many good wishes to you and all viewers,positive

“as a rule fight’s between two rhinos don’t even end with injuries” pretty certain that rhino fights have the highest mortality rate of any mammal other than humans,negative
i cant even imagine what the poor warthog had gone through the air mr narratorthe air,negative
the best part of this video is you getting the names of animals wrong the goat in the second clip made me roar,positive
the african leopard is the worst case scenario for humans a complete predator which intermediates between lions and cheetahs swift stealth agile and resentful you can run and climb but you cant hide,negative
well made informative and entertaining ty for including imperial measurements i wish all makers would do the same,positive
its nice to observe the wild animals fighting each other ,positive
i love how everybody comments on how he gets the names wrong lol,positive
also i think what you call shapeshifter is a newly discovered type of squid the lights are possible for a sea creature as we see deep water has lights well its no underwater electricity but its something,positive
for the megalodon vs whale i think that the creature that just scooped up the whale it not a shark it doesnt seem like a normal attack of a shark,negative
the socalled “turtle snake” 1024 is a hoax the only thing real was the blurred out fish guts the rest was said most likely to be cardboard andor papiermâché,negative

you know we’ve fallen short as a species when animals have to remind us how to show unconditional love for one another,negative
that stray dog helping that lady had me in tears he is a keeper i wish he finds himself the family he deserves that dog right there was a real life hero protected a complete stranger as if his own master,positive
it warms my heart to see animals trying to save other animals even a small fish where a human would have left it to die animals are so much smarter than we think they know things even we do not animals care way more than humans do they are not greedy but only take what they need and help others to survive even ones that are not of its own kind that is the true way to live in this world animals deserve so much more kindness than we give them next time you see a animal give it the respect and kindness it deserves,positive
in my experience pets have demonstrated more humanity than humans ever did love the vid,positive

after reading comments i agree i felt ripped off so i decided to search for fattest giraffe and there are many copies of that particular photo with a few that have been squished or spread to make it look even fatter yet there was also one sitting in someones hand suspicious i know but i was more amazed to find a very overweight tiger one animal i would not expect to get fat also huge prairie dog and a very fat horse some animals labelled morbidly obese could turn up more,negative
its so sad to see the ones that were truly loved by their elderly owners they never meant to harm their fur babies,negative
i wish they had more footage on deep blue there are only two videos of her that i know about that original one and the one where they saw her off the coast of hawaii just watching her swim around impresses me she is huge,positive

dont care what anyone says an orchestra puts so much more oomph and power behind a song like this now its on a completely different level ,positive
the orchestra looks like they are enjoying it and that makes me really happy,positive
whoever arranged the orchestral parts is brilliant instead of the usual treatment of trying to fit the song into an orchestral piece they fit the orchestra to the song this has got to be one of the best if not the best orchestral versions of a hard rockmetal song ive seen,positive
i’m a violinist in an orchestra and i listen to architects this is like the best thing ever happened in my life,positive

fantastic documentary hope we as humans preserve all of the species and for that matter all animalplant life for generations to come snow leopards are just astonishing,positive
this is 1000 times better than any movie thanks so much love to the production management,positive
i can actually feel whats shown here without actually being there in the wild beautiful creatures and masterfully lensed,positive
i love the goose noises coming from the crow at 1301 and the horse noises for the zebras totally accurate,positive
there is a big mistake in this the dazzle camouflage doesnt work to hide the zebra in the grass its designed to make it difficult to judge distance to a target so when the lion goes to attack the zebra he might pounce too soon and when he is in the chase he will find it difficult when to strike out with his claws the same thing was used against submarines,negative
is this original footage or from somewhere else regardless it looks freakin fantastic the editing is superb,positive

love the videos but surprised you didn’t mention polar bear or shark whale,positive
i love animal videos but this one has some flat out incorrect information elephants for example do not find humans cute spreading that kind of information is what leads people to underestimating an animal and getting themselves hurt wild animals are just that wild they can be socialized but that does not mean tame or domesticated,negative
thanks for another great vid so interesting but damn im so glad theres a screen between me and most of these animals,positive
i have video footage of a elk ripping the front of my brother in laws pick up truck apart he was pissed of at my brother in law because he made the sound of a male that thing was 200 yards away when he did that and let me tell you i felt like i barely made into the truck in time that was only 15 feet from us ive never seen such power in real life it was insane that was on vancouver island just for your info,negative

this is why field trips are soooo good they create an atmosphere of curiosity and learning its sad how in high school we get much less,positive

you forgot the most important function of school to make children hate learning,negative
i hope you all realize the incredible scope of possibilities and opportunities you introduce to young people today for the most part i think you do and i appreciate all the commitment and energy which shows in the outcome every time i think of crash course and the whole insights and enlightenment genre of youtube for that matter i think of for want of a nail and i wonder what id be doing now if the possibilities you introduce to viewers with such comparative ease in this time wouldve been around in the 70s thank you,positive

i love that as part of additional recourses for our sociology class we have these videos it is also funny how our teacher is always warning us that its focused a lot on american context d which is true because from this video it looks like usa has one of the best educational systems which is deffinetly not true here in the czech republic compulsory school attendance functions since 1774 also our entire educational system is free and there is no religon in most schools public or private of course there are many countries that have worse educational system than usa but i dont think you have the best one but its just my opinion so please dont come at me d,positive
educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition neighborhood preconceptions of people and income which affects how much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil student it’s fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in loved the references you used as well james,positive
pleaseeee do these for uk sociological structures because most of your videos have helped my alevels so far and are incredibly helpful,positive
we are teaching our children the wrong things in school we are creating a societal system where each section is dependent upon the other sections this means when one section fails then the rest also fail we need to teach our children to be independent instead we teach children how to be obedient workers to give meaning to someones life teach them how to grow their own food build their own house repair their own car cook their own meals eat to stay healthy and most importantly how to meditate and pray this gives life meaning,negative
interesting my learning style is slow,positive
my grade 8 science project back in the late 80s was on learning styles my teacher was shocked and surprised when i submitted my project idea all my subjects were my classmates over a span of a couple weeks i tested their comprehension of certain short stories pictures and videos through visual audio and reading when the science fair day came my booth wasnt the most popular with any of the other kids but with all the school teachers and parents they loved it i remember the results of my project was inconclusive because i tested each student individually with each individual method of learning no one method of learning is better than another but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen but i ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due,positive
i worked as a high school teacher for thirty years over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory learning style was just one of many nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories presented as facts demanding evidence and proof ever yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher so you had no choice at least whilst being observed i became quite cynical in the end because i realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their cv and each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one god forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience education and intelligence,negative
i had an excellent and very intense mathematical statistics professor for whom varying teaching style was his teaching style i recall one day for an hour long lecture he came in and wrote notes and provided examples and proofs and he never said a single word in another day he switched his handwriting to beautiful perfect cursive he was a bizarre teacher but pushed me to the absolute limit great prof,positive
i’ve been selfstudying alevel maths for the last two years and i think the real method to learning in my own experience is ‘repetition’ similar to how you would work out in a gym the more you do it the better you become at it i think i’ve taught myself more in the last two years than any of my teachers ever did in school,positive
im a pressure learner i only learn school material when theres severe stress and doubts about my future imposed on me,negative
people learn easier when they are interested and is enjoying to know a topic also if you understand schooling as the obligation of attend to school and have satisfying grades and education as acquire knowledge through studying for self interest it will not only be clearer that we learn only what we want to know but also that several government regulations on schools around the globe is actually making people dumber,negative
im a teacher in new zealand and vark was covered in my teaching degree 17 years ago we did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching ie try and give the children a verbal aspect and an auditory aspect and a reading aspect and a kinaesthetic aspect that sounds more like the multimodal approach you described i remember i came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well she looked at it and said i dont want to read all that cant you read it to me,positive
i feel like the learning styles myth has ultimately helped teaching though its encouraged teachers to be more multimodal in their teaching style in order to in their minds reach a wider variety of learners even if the hypothesis was wrong its ultimately created a stronger teaching style,positive
twenty years ago i gave a small talk about vark to my fellow educators the key point in my plenary was that learning styles are not separate but complement each other in a holistic manner over 47 years i have found many keys to assisting students to learn humour comfort having eaten slept well etc pause frequently to review points question your own knowledge openly and invite students to do the same as they learn i loved teaching and was only persuaded to finish when the paperwork before and after took more time than the educating,positive
im glad i live in the age of the internet i learn every day ive never stopped being a student,positive
its official im opening a school like this if im rich when im older or maybe even if im poor i really dont care i just want a school like this,positive
i personally believe children and students should be taught to think for themselves they should learn to debate solve problems and be encouraged,positive
this video speaks to my soul im training to be a teacher at the moment and its not what i imagined i dont feel like its what i should do with my life but this video has revived me slightly and reminded me that this wasis my vision and not to be bogged down by the current system awesome videos,positive
every single one of these videos is perfectly made with amazing points everything is so well thought out these videos make the world a better place,positive
i am a teacher i love my job and i need to tell you this is happening in schools it is pushed for students to learn and understand life problems we call it the hidden curriculum it is what teachers facilitate in their classrooms teachers put students in many situations and help guide them in appropriate ways or guidance about finding themselves and their interests or understanding money which is definitely in the curriculum you are correct it is not as blatant as this example and i wish it were more but your next video i would love to see your solution to this problem the education system knows this is where we want to go they just dont know how,positive
its official im opening a school like this if im rich when im older or maybe even if im poor i really dont care i just want a school like this,positive
great video i look forward to teaching my children these valuable lessons if the current curriculum doesnt go over these important subjects,positive
schools definitely needs to teach the various biases and fallacies funny thing about them is that by simply knowing people will commit much less of them this is one of the purest example of knowledge is power and most certainly belongs in a curriculum,positive
great work the school of life its really heart warming that you made an effort to study the current education system and provided with a simple solution like focusing on the life challenging subjects having said that i dont want this to be just anther video i want us all to collaborate and design a real time working ed system test and work on it at small scale first then making it biggerlater because i dont want the future and the current generation to suffer the same fate as we did peace3,positive
as someone who grew up doing common core— it just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other common core materials for essentially no benefit to the students i can’t recall a single time common core was spoken of positively by the teachers or the other students,negative
so we found that the problem wasn’t the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in and rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame it was easier to say “kids aren’t learning because there’s something wrong with the books teachers and schools” i love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance now we’ve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live,negative
i dropped out of high school when i was held back in 11th grade and got my ged at 2 weeks before my 19th birthday the ged tests were way easier than end of the year tests in regular school,positive
schools need to push to hold back students instead of pushing them to a level out of their league until they give up the students that are showing much slower growth need to be put into an alternative careerlife focused schoolclassesprogram,negative
lets perform it on a positive note the culture and ecology have to be healthy for starters schools have to be safe and secure it has to be supportive of learning curve for the students the student must take extreme ownership of the curricula the subject matters must be based on science learning methods must be evidencebased yes im a seasoned stem teacher by the way,positive
apologies for not watching the whole video as a former student and a parent of students i know the system was broken long before common core i remember in college my english 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide because i was so deficient on the basicsthough i did well in english all through school i had to take remedial math because my high school didnt prepare me for college coursesthough i graduated with the required credits things have gone down since i was a student and my kids had schools with very high standards but very low expectations that means there were a lot of advanced classes offeredlike calculusbut so many ways to accept failure they had to take history and social studies but only had to pass one the policy of no child left behind was an additional failure as it meant no one failed or was held back even though they wouldnt graduate on time kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted too much government involvement means teachers arent allowed to teach we have some phenomenal teachers who are underpaid with far too much nonteaching responsibility heaped on them schools arent just expected to educate students now theyve got to feed them clothe them teach them manners and how to get along look out for abuse deal with all their special needs and accompanying ieps head off bullying deal with allergies and medical conditions worry about gender identity and sexuality discipline fairly deal with helicopter parents check the boxes for college prep and deal with the everpresent worry over school shootings with all were expecting from schools and teachers its a wonder anyone goes into this profession or stays once they see the outlook common core like no child left behind is a great idea on paper that fails in implementation my kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were welleducated there was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students it meant even more testing for studentsto judge whether their teachers were up to the task at the same time they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do betterlike tenure they promoted the best teachers out of the classroom they took away teaching assistants due to the costs they increased class sizes and they started charter schoolswhich were experimental programs imagine if all those billions spent on common core were used to pay teachers moreand get out of their way,negative

ive been studying with the traditional academia style from my chidhood and i think this was one of the reasons of my deep unhappiness everytime i had to go to the school and i agree the system can be totally useless when it comes to study died things in only books and not providing experiential oportunities to learn for children its a very serious matter that i hope will dramatically change very soon i adapted to the system and became succesful in the studies but i can tell not in life sharing my experience all the best to you guys,negative
thanks well done sprouts and the visuals are just amazing deweys theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for education it it is therefore easier to implement in a private school setting as compared to a public school one a critic would be how possible is it to find enough time within the term to implement the learning by doing eg planting and watching plants grow while at the same time covering the required syllabus for the discussions it is important that some teacher instructions and prior reading and research happens before for the discussiondebate to be meaningful enough to sprout out new perspectives and ideas for the interdisciplinary aspect to work very strong school leadership is essential as well as a strong teamwork culture among staff as it would require a lot of sharing consultations planning and constant reviews,positive

 these are some most important and precious advices every one should read  1 take risks in your life if you win you can lead if you lose you can guide 2 people are not what they say but what they do so judge them not from their words but from their actions 3 when someone hurts you dont feel bad because its a law of nature that the tree that bears the sweetest fruits gets maximum number of stones 4 take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you it takes even your last breath 5 in this world people will always throw stones on the path of your success it depends on what you make from them a wall or a bridge 6 challenges make life interesting overcoming them make life meaningful 7 there is no joy in victory without running the risk of defeat 8 a path without obstacles leads nowhere 9 past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay 10 you cant have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time 11 if what you did yesterday still looks big to you then you havent done much today 12 if you dont build your dreams someone else will hire you to build theirs 13 if you dont climb the mountain you cant view the plain 14 dont leave it idle use your brain 15 you are not paid for having brain you are only rewarded for using it intelligently 16 it is not what you dont have that limits you it is what you have but dont know how to use 17 what you fail to learn might teach you a lesson 18 the difference between a corrupt person and an honest person is the corrupt person has a price while the honest person has a value 19 if you succeed in cheating someone dont think that the person is a fool realize that the person trusted you much more than you deserved i 20 honesty is an expensive gift dont expect it from cheap people i hope you have learnt something you can recieve more from my this channel,positive

this thing is also evident in india students preparing for neetjee and for many other competitive exams who pay lakhs of fees in coaching institutes get a remarkable edge over the students who cant afford to go to these coachings most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are iitians doctors etc these coachings provide great facilities to their students so the results are obvious there are very few government colleges of class 11 and 12 in india who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams also what i have noticed is that its not just the school that you go to matters but also the kind of peer group which you have also the support and thinking of your parents and the overall society and environment in which live matters when it comes to education,positive

i used to work for those online tutoring companies they wanted native english speakers and promised you 16 but would dock your pay for things like yawning on screen the pace was insane i was fired for not smiling enough the burnout rate was very very high especially because you had to get up at about 4 am to do it if you lived in america the kids would be really young the youngest i tutored was 3 too young to understand anything at all and be in pajamas and finishing up their dinner so like the last thing they wanted to do was stare at a computer and learn english especially because the age range seemed to be 57yearolds sometimes they would pick up the laptop they were on and just run around the room with it and the parents would give us bad marks for not keeping their child engaged enough it was a really horrible job for both companies i worked for,negative
in kenya i experienced the same the kcse is the one exam that can make or break your life i slept for 5 hours a day lessons from 5 am to 8 pm it was stressful the pressure from parents and society is sometimes too much i am glad it is all gone,negative
im 17 this year and am studying in an international high school in shenzhen china i was in public school until high school im grateful my parents provided me the opportunity to leave that stressful system but i heard from my former classmates who are in the system that in recent years the pressure on that system has been declining but i cant be assured because im no longer in that system recalling my dark days in that system ive always hated it because there was a lot of transcribing homework and memorizing poems and passages when you fail to remember them teachers will punish you by transcribing the poems and passages several times i understand the reason why our government has such a system because we have such a vast population and i do think its relatively fair even though its fairness is declining especially when this double reduction policy came down,negative
ive been an edtech consultant in beijing for 7 years ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools there are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive the first and foremost factor i would note is the lack of public discourse this permeates through every part of society especially education if you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection in education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember the second factor of note is barriers of information the public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it on top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as vipkids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations this causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name eg wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it the third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge as stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection if youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies how can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences the result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content the fourth factor is lack of foreign talent there are not enough qualified teachers to meet demand the general population would not be able to recognize one either many companies hire russians call them american and slap a 200 markup on the course its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents the final factor is who the decision makers are who decides what national curriculum is starting in 2020 private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum this topdown decision making only exasperates the situation it also permeates throughout the society ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best i should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program as for price its simply about demand vs supply lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost they will pay upwards of 200k rmb just to make it happen for their little middle schooler unfortunately i exited the market partially because the clients i had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum,negative
the problem i have with those overly stressful education systems is that i wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them what i learned through selfdefense practice and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus and are not an effective way to learn in selfdefense instructors increase stress by making you do cardiobased exercises to make your body artificially feel stress accelerated heartbeat difficulty to breath difficulty to focus only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal but they dont do it for learning purposes the military seems to do it too in their own way i would also point out that every doctor in the world with common sense would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue its funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stressfree education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months i wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries here in france we dont have that type of education system nor in the united kingdom i studied for 2 years at a british university,negative
i never really agreed with this kind of education system i live in malaysia my earliest childhood memories were ever only filled with tuitions left and right no play until you finish your homework if you fail to memorise spellings you will be punished back then i never really thought much of it but now that i’m in college being exposed to a more western type of education system made me question this kind of practice it never helpd me improve my academic i was always dead last in class all it ever did to me was lowering my self confidence and give me anxiety im never going back to those times,negative

i found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty,positive
ive been listening to this guys speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything i have seen in a long time i was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school this wonderful psychologist actually told me in 5th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so i know so i spent 5 years believing i had adhd when all i had was this thing called childhood eventually in 10th grade i switched to an alternative school and everything robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on im a senior at my alternative school going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me ill spare the details but i just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what im most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and i will do everything in my power to achieve this i wouldnt have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity much thanks to ken robinson for his words of wisdom and innspiration andsharing his vision with us,positive

i certainly remember being much better at being creative when i was younger but now that im a freshman in high school ive noticed that im much worse at the whole creativity thing now the problem is im being praised why i am great at finding the one answer i can take tests very well but am typically not the best at projects math is my best subject english is my worst where you typically have to write creative essays i want to be an engineer so at my school we have an elective called preengineering its one of the closest classes to an actual job thats available at my school and im not the best at it sure i can do the math required but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard i feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future its telling me that theres one answer which is never the case in engineering i hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul and realize that we need to change education,negative

just in case you didnt know bedrock edition has a chance of not having a portal room this makes it really hard for speedrunners to use bedrock because if they get to the strong hold in just 10 minutes it might not even have a portal room,negative
fact we learn more on the internet from travelling and meeting people than we have at school,positive
i used to write so well and elaborate descriptions were super easy my pen flowed on paper like butter but ever since my teacher screamed at me for exceeding the word limit in the exam i got so discouraged that i gave up on writing and now i cant even write a simple essay school really does kill creativity dont let that happen to you,negative
these creative children have turned into these teenagers who are unwilling to think outside the box im only 13 and i felt that in my soul,negative
this is extremely true one example my brother is amazing at art hes super talented but he keeps getting cs and ds in art because he doesnt do what hes told he challenges the teachers there are people in his class who jave absolutely no skill but get higher grades because the do exactly what they are told and dont think outside the box the teachers are literally trying in limit children creativity in an art room,positive
education is when you learn from your mistakes school is where you get mocked for your mistakes,negative
everyone is intelligent but our grades made us idiots jabin baret 2021,negative
what parents expect from us during school constant straight a’s good social life all that what they don’t expect stress depression social awkwardness school just sucks having to determine all self worth on a high or low grade just makes you upset and then fear what happens as a consequence i hate how parents don’t understand that school can genuinely give a child depression and mental health issues because they refuse to think like their child they always say that we aren’t depressed just faking it for attention i had a mental breakdown once all i was asked was why did i cry and that there had to be a reason a person should not have a damn reason to express themselves it’s just bs,negative
i loved my 7th and 8th grade math teacher his goal was to make the class love math he said he loved when people failed and he also only checked homework because the school system made him he did the best he was allowed to and this goes to show that you shouldnt blame the teachers you shouldnt blame the people who designed the school system around 150 years ago you should blame the people who keep the school system the same never changing it to suite modern needs more modern schools are near identical to ones over 150 years ago which were designed to mass produce factory workers let that sink in,positive
its true education is a neverending process i feel formal education doesnt teach you to learn from your failures but rather punish you,negative
absulotely a very useful one and i learned today to spread this knowledge as much as i can ,positive
in starting its boring but later we love it,positive
i agree with this on so many levels it’s weird take my like,positive
who is behind this channel this is very kind and honest step to aware others in real thanks for this i really appreciate and loving this work of yours,positive
 we should improve and educate ourselves to succeed ,positive
thanks for the videonow i realise why education is so importanti have read and studied about abraham maslow but yet i cnt figure it out myself not until now,positive
thank you for your amazing video ,positive
as a 33 year veteran teacher i suggest that you talk to teachers about their working conditions the disrespect has infected the classrooms teachers are being verbally and physically attacked by students and even parents on a daily basis a lot of this stems from mental health issues yet nothing is ever done about it,negative
low wages harassment bullying karens lack of security respect paperwork working conditions pay safety updated and fact based books etc plus who the heck wants to worry about being murdered at their job not having security taken seriously by those in charge this will never happen at are school attitude,negative
its hardly surprising even in rich districts teachers are underpaid undervalued and overworked they are expected to take on more responsibilities every year with fewer and fewer resources all while administrators ignore their pleas and parents treat them like overqualified babysitters my wife quit teaching several years ago she was working 67 days a week and spending hundreds of dollars a month on supplies just to keep her classroom running and the school gave her absolutely no support with unruly students,negative
respect for teachers is not just about the salary although an increase in salary is sorely needed teacher pay has always been lower than other professions with the same education and experience its also about respect for the profession student behavior in my view can be linked to the disrespect for teachers theyre seeing parents administrators and politicians demonstrate hiring a person trained as a soldier to teach is very disrespectful to the profession as a teacher i dont feel qualified to do the job of a soldier i respect the profession too much the anybody can teach attitude is not only insulting its ignorant,negative
who wants to get shot in the classroom while trying to protect these disrespectful students who cuss you out on a daily basis,negative
i was raised in a teaching family when the profession was respected and teacher strikes unheard of fast forward to a major university where teaching majors walk away from the profession after their first classroom experiences why would any sane person want to be in a job when they are disrespected or not trusted so much,negative
decades of we need to cut the education budget created an environment where supplies are now being provided at cost to the teachers larger classes low respect with more flak being thrown their way this year due to bs rhetoric denigration from political grand standers and then pile on top this push for parents wanting to directly interfere in the teachers professional conduct you have caused the great resignation of teachers own up to it and fix your funding priorities,negative
so it turns out that if you underpay and undervalue teachers nobody wants to be a teacher huh go figure,negative
bernie thank you for giving the proper voice to this critical issue biden threw a bone much more help for regular people is needed systemic change is needed in the educational debt industry,positive
because a healthy and educated country is a strong country thank you senator sanders for all you do,positive
the cost of education in this country is crazy if we want to have an educated workforce we need more affordable education,negative
here we are in the 20th century in the usa and education is a luxury something is very wrong with this picture thank you bernie for your deft combination of common sense and wisdom,negative
stop funding wars and start funding education and health care its taxpayer money let we the people vote on how to spend it,negative
its outrageous that union organizers are excluded from the debt forgiveness program sounds like something the republicans and corporate dems would have agreed to include in the bill,negative
bravo bernie a good argument for education and training is you will need less of the welfare state not more,positive
so sad why are federal student loan interest rates so high we need workers with skills in this country my husband died at 66 and his one wish was to pay off our daughter’s graduate school loan and our daughter in law’s undergraduate loan i did that and now have a new granddaughter we need to lift this burden to help all with this kind of debt,negative
incredible we have to starve the narcissists of people to do business with bernie thank you bernie for getting our weak voices out there with complaints that we can view publically so we know we are not alone that there are people both in our shoes and also those willing to help from their care for us and our problems,positive
bernie for president 2024 ,positive
i’m 67 years old and have lived my entire life in mississippi 43 is a huge win in that every time i have observed state rankings regarding quality of life issues we are nearly always 50 the reason we have come up in the rankings is that my daughter is a teacher in the mississippi public school system and she raised mississippi’s ranking seven points by herself i am very proud,positive
as someone whos from md and lives in pa pennsylvania came higher than i expected and maryland was lower baltimore probably dragged maryland down but pa is a surprise thats because pennsylvania schools are funded through a system called school taxes where each of the 500 school districts spread across 67 counties levy their own property taxes to fund their schools thats why someone living next door to you can be paying twice as much in taxes to go to a school half as good this system has been known to disproportionately affect rural and urban school districts and tip in favor of school districts in suburban communities or those in the poconos where they have resorts that people own condos at,negative
just moved my family from ny to va and although ny is one level higher in education what we gained as a family with piece of mind among everything else is priceless great  video briggs,positive
according to wallethub the best state in the country for “quality of education” is massachusetts followed by california according to research released january 21 2019 by wallethub the study was part of wallethub’s annual ranking of the “most least educated states in america” this year’s ranking combined two categories — educational attainment and quality of education — broken down by 20 “relevant metrics” massachusetts placed first in both categories followed by california while the educational attainment category is based solely on the percentage of residents with high school associates undergraduate and graduate diplomas quality of education includes 16 metrics ranging from quality of public high schools to quality of public universities to educational attainment based on gender and race within that category california follows massachusetts rounding out the top five for quality of education are florida maryland and vermont respectively,positive
i grew up in mass and the schools were excellent that said my kids go to school in los angeles and there are some great public schools here my daughter went to a french immersion public school in glendale ca i felt like she got a pretty amazing and unique education,positive
the closest i got to college was watching the professor on gilligans island that must put me a few points ahead,positive
im from ca and i find this super surprising while overall our stats suck when you look at the exceptions the smart kids here astound me at dimanomd bar i knew this kid who was talking calc 1 as a sophmore in high school i also met this taiwanese girl who was taking data structures and algorithms at 16 and recently got into uc berkeley i think while overall our stays suck our top scholars here can top other scholars after all the uc system has some of the most prestigious universities according to us news,positive
nothings wrong with going to college its the fact that we are traditionally taught that we all need to go to college to be successful when in fact college isnt for everyone and especially isn’t the only way to succeed in life same people that tell you to go to college are paying debt still from it how the rich stay rich and poor stay poor,negative
exactly as a member of genx a lot of us are still paying off our loans but yet are gonna send our kids to do the same thing 20 years later i think not i say this as a person with a bachelors and masters degree i encourage young people to get as much education for free or as cheaply as they can the important thing is output if you produce good work academic or otherwise youll always be in demand with the internet people are able to start all sorts of income producing ventures without high overhead you can become a software programmer using tutorials online and make plenty of money you can learn a trade with only two years of study via community college if youve got the mind to start your own company afterwards then get a business degree when youre able to pay as you go you can learn digital marketing without a degree,positive
my son is a senior in high school this year he says he might choose community college but doesnt want a 4 year university trade school is fine too i think he just doesnt know what he wants to do with his life yet and thats okay i went to college and spent 12 years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me i dont understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they havent even had the opportunity to live life yet i want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one im in no rush to kick him out all i ask is that he works or goes to school i dont want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job i want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly i dont want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet he can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so theres no age limit,negative
as a millenial i cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow how much could colleges charge and get away with how far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place now that the next gen has seen the effects they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security universities is just way too expensiveon top of that theres cost of housing and food and transportation if it were more affordable i truly believe more kids absolutely would go but if someone in that position asked me for advice i would always advise them to at least complete community college and 2 year degrees or certification programs at the very least in a practical field many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs,negative
i find this so awesome i hope these colleges are forced to significantly drop their prices they sucked american students dry crippled an entire generation of millennials from being homeowners and ever building financial security now its finally coming to a head and its long overdue i hope students find great jobs and stay out of debt,positive
i started my career in the food industry as a shelf stocker at a grocery store then was promoted to merchandiser then to a buyer a vendor later asked me to join them doing sales fast forward to today i’m 36 still doing sales but now in the seafood industry and make about 150k gross annually not bad for someone that didn’t go to college find what you’re good at and work hard at it college isn’t for everyone,positive
when education becomes a business instead of a right this is what happens,negative
well lets consider this most nations give free college to their citizens here in the us however we charge them to attend colleges that would make our nation more educated and more adept at highskilled jobs its almost like we want our population to suffer while we are going threw an economic crisis but hey lets ignore that completely right,negative
instead of being mad cause people only know this song because of gta you should be glad todays games show great music to the new generations,positive
love the lyric “believe it or not there’s life after high school” and daryl’s expression while singing it ,positive
my son was playing gtai was like you listen to hall and oates worlds collided that day,positive
thank gta for putting some classics on the radio hits different when your cruising down the highway and this comes on,positive
if you dont like hall and oates then you probably dont like music,negative

russel brand did a really good job here he made the interview light and enjoyable and at the same time probed yuval to go deeper into his ideas than ive seen him go in other interviews,positive
it seems to me that the purpose of life is to contribute to society and do good things and the purpose of education is to learn how to interpret and understand the world students need to learn the language of the world they need a good solid understanding of the basics then they can adapt to anything and be better prepared to contribute,positive
oh how i love russell brand listen to him praise the students for the quality of their questions he is such a great example of raising each other up,positive
thanks for this its so relevant and i heard some excellent questions and i liked the way they were answered and how sometimes brand translated or summed up hararis answers it made things even more clear and focussed than the talks and interviews i had watched and read in the past little while the audience was fabulous and asked the best questions ever,positive
coming to this in 2020 isolated and away from my kids thousands of km awaymy son chose to read theology i had read law politics and economics and retain a keen interest in these areas i had discouraged his choice and questioned it i was probably wrong,negative
india is a country of a billion people but if anyone ever says that stuff again ask them what is the addressable market for their product and watch the fun ill bet my money 99 of these so called entrepreneurs dont know how big their market actually is thats why they can never convert their company into conglomerates,negative
i dont know why people dont watch interviews they are as insightful if not more,negative
you never disappoint ,positive
masters union cannot replace institutions like iim or iit because of the sheer fact that mu does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university indian colleges or universities dont have any place in the top institutes of the world and rightly so but something that an iit or iim has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy because of the implementation of reservation there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into iims and iits be lacking in certain core subjects dont assume i am a casteist because i am outlining a drawback in reservation policy i completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who havent had access to great education in their schoolscolleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education but in an institution like masters union going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds who have had access to great education since kindergarten while masters union assures great education institutions like iits and iims ensure social equity and great education the entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in mu,negative

that glass panebeacon thing was neat i liked that though i find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general i kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam i know vanilla tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me but that doesnt mean everyone isnt seeming my base just surrounded in beams maybe they could make tinted glass function as a beam nullifier while still maintaining effects thatd be nice,positive
ive been using the door trick for years had a base entrance that used it once only problem is since they added crawling if you dont time it right you get sandwiched under the top block of the door,negative

dang i liked hearing twice the toycat but also glad they decided that having the vote on twitter where alts and people who dont have the game can vote wasnt the best idea,positive
i am excited for the prospect that like the example test vote the mob vote may last a longer period of time like 24 hours because they usually happen at like 3am my time hopefully a larger section of the playerbase will end up getting to vote with the new system,positive
i feel a bit ripped off by the cape i bought both versions of the game but bedrock edition on the xbox and java well on a pc i still bought both versions since windows 10 and xbox are the exact same but i will not be getting the cape since you had to buy windows 10 and xbox separately meaning they see them as two different items though it’s the exact same version of the game just different platforms edit they are indeed the same email of course though they might hopefully surprise me and this is just a worry about nothing,positive
i liked the broken audio version better felt like we could hear inside toycat’s head,positive
the goal of capes is to be a reward for a thing and to be rare and there are some that are rarer than others now it’s just one more cape in the wild of all the minecraft account some capes are more rare adding an account more value because you deserved it,positive
i hope if theyre going to use this server for voting issues the server can handle the traffic else it will be a very laggy experience for all of us,negative

i’m taking my first sat exam this saturday junior here taking internationally trying to aim for at least a 1400…  may luck be with all of us ,positive
great tips i also tell my students to chill on fridays if you train for a marathon why would you run a full marathon the day before your race same goes for your brain i also like that you mentioned learning from your mistakes the key is to make sure you go back over your practice i tell my students to not write the correct answers and go back and retry the problems they missed to see if they can get the right answer the second time around thanks for the video,positive
even after practicing more than 1600 questions till now im not able to cross the 1300 barrier i have given 5 practice tests till today and my scores are 1350 1310 1250 1310 and 1320 what could be the probable reason according to you please help i really feel frustrated and hopeless now to think that even after practicing so many questions im not able to get a 1400 score edit ive given one attempt and my score was 1310,negative

thank you for this usually talking about the sat brings me so much stress but this calmed me down thank you,positive
hey there checkout my 6 hour sat math crash course use code first100 for 25 off join my mailing list here for updates deals and more,positive
thanks for sharing the “study like it’s your last test” even though you’re taking it twice is an interesting approach i get the value in it but i actually say the opposite to my students because they get so stressed out i tell them not to worry and just relax in there because they can always take it again also the focus on the math first i like i’ll actually have them only do one portion of the test with me for the whole month or two and then take the test and then do the other portion for a whole month or two to superscore,positive
hi ritesh im a brazilian student ive been studying for the sat like crazy for the past months my goal is a 1500 but im stuck at the 1460 ive scored 1500 a month ago on mock but only 1460 ever since and i feel it is a lot due to my mentalitystress do you recommend anything for me to relax or review so i can actually get a 1500,negative
hi ritesh verma first of all i want to say bunch of thanks for helping us with your incredible skills and knowledges i have a quatiosn for you is it possible change sat exam test date and how can we do this i found from my collage board change resigtration but i couldnt change my test date and test center…,positive
hey man do you have any tips to avoid silly errors i get errors just due to carelessness or not reading the passage thoroughly do you have any tips for that,negative
quick question i got a 1380 on a previous official sat i made some stupid math mistakes but killed the english section for the most part can i still clutch up and get that 1400 through a bunch of studying or is that a strechthis is my first sat btw,negative
tomorrows my sat exam and trust me this was the best video that i have seen so far for the reading section thank you anna,positive
you literally just made a super hard test seem like a fifth grade spelling test thank you,positive
that tip on twopart questions is probably the best sat tip ive ever gotten thanks,positive
the sat reading section was like torture to me i would get 20 questions wrong all the time but with alot of hard work and dedication i ended up getting a 690 on it you can do this guys,negative
super helpful i’m not exaggerating if i said this one of the most valuable videos about sat on youtube thanks a lot wish me luck for december’s sat,positive
u seem rly genuine and u dont give off the vibes that u just made this video to boast so thank u for that,positive
im an sat tutor and this taught me a few excellent tips ive never seen or thought ofespecially those intimidating 2 questionevidence ones impressive thx,positive
this helped me get a 770 on reading bringing my superscore to 1570 thanks,positive

wow tomorrow is my test and i have been studying all summer this video was more helpful than all my summer studying combined i took a sat prep course at my school also i mean it thank you,positive

here in india even 7th class exam comes harder than this,negative
straight forward with no bs thank you this is so much better than any professional help,positive
ive been studying on khan academy for a couple of weeks now using their sat practice problems watching you do this has helped me so much more than that has thus far thanks,positive
ive taken the sat 3 times the most frustrating part about the sat is that unless youre at an advanced level in math or above the normal level for your grade theres a high chance you wont understand or even recognize over 50 of the material and questions the first time i took it i barely understood a lot of the math on it because i wasnt even completely through algebra 2 long story short i hate standardized testing and i feel as though a lot of kids are set up for failure tt im lucky i got to take it multiple times this year since i understand most of the math now,negative
im going to take the test in five days and i just found out this video  thanks for sharing,positive
really informative thank you,positive
omg as an international student i was kinda hopeless abt this exam before i found your channel bu damn your videos are lit and i feel better now ,positive

hey thank you so much for your help do you have any tips for sophomores taking the psat for the first time i greatly appreciate it,positive
you are unique bro thanks a lot for your time and effort,positive
i watched this video and somehow raised my score from 1430 sept 26 sat to 1500 oct 3 sat in 1 week wow thank you so much,positive
i wanted at least a 1300 that was my goal my minimum i got an 1170 now i’m retaking it senior year but i’m completely dejected i have a couple weeks left i’m really trying to understand things better people are counting on me,negative
this is so helpful i’m also trying to raise my original score around 300 points to get in the 1500s range and seeing that you were able too helps me see that it’s possible,positive
let me tell you my story first time i took my psat when i was in freshmen year and i got a 560  i took it again in sophomore year and i got 940 i took the psat again in junior year and i got 1200 i’ve been self studying past 5 months and i think i can get 1400,positive
my tip if you know you’re taking the act study for that first the timing of the act is much faster so if you study hard and get used to it the sat will seem like a piece of cake at least that’s how it was for me,positive
honestly for me at least knowing that there will be another opportunity really relieved my test anxiety and i ended up with a much better score than i predicted,positive
that’s so funny… we got the exact same first two sat scores 1190 and 1360 hoping that’s a good sign and through hard work and dedication there will be a 1510 in my future,positive
i took it at the end of my sophomore year and got a 1310 just took it again 2 months into junior year and got a 1400 my superscore is a 1440 combining my 2 tests hoping this video helps me reach the 1500 i want by the end of my junior year,positive
thank you so much i’m currently studying for the sat as well and i really recommend the college panda books including erika meltzer’s critical reading for the reading section,positive
totally not trying to cram everything in one night good luck on everyone else who’s taking it tomorrow small update the test wasn’t so bad i think overall it’s the stress we put on ourselves just be sure to read everything carefully and not to second guess too much if a question is hard skip it and come back later get the points you know you for certain understand and can get and then the rest,positive
god bless this man im a college drop out whos trying his best to go back to school and get his education degree but never took the sat while i was in high school 21 btw hoping i can pull thru and prove myself as a capable individual,positive
i have my sat next week and i think this was the most useful 26 minutes of my entire quarantine thank you,positive
this gives me so much more confidence i love the way you easily break it down in a way and quickly explain it all really needed this,positive
i wish i wouldve looked for this video a lot sooner the sat is tomorrow for me,negative
i took mine in march and i’m not happy with my score so i’m retaking in in 2 weeks june this video has been an amazing help just finished the first one and about to move on to the next one great video and fantastic explanation,positive
you did a great job sat math is not easy i wish it was easier for students to beat it good luck guys,positive
you know i am always extremely stressed out during the sat so my mind gets cluttered because im thinking of all the things it could be asking but the fact that this is all just summarized so well honestly helps me out big time for my sat happening next year thank you for the help d,positive

to everyone watching this video it works all math that you will see on the exam is reviewed in this video my score went up 150 points after watching this video im taking the sat this saturday to shoot for the 1500s but i just wanted to say that this is an amazing video and it really is comprehensive good use of your time to watch this 2 days before your test date and do at least one practice test,positive
just here trying to learn 3 years of math into my head in a weekend before the test on tuesday april 13 2021 we all in the same struggle good luck to who ever reading this on your sat,negative
graduated 24 years ago when a sat or act was not required now im looking at going to college and have to take the sat or act after 24 years thank you it helps to find a crash course still very nervous but this helps,positive
you did a great job explaining nothing is easy on math sat a question could be 5 sentences long and your heart just drops anyone who takes sat is a hero press on guys,positive
to each and every one of you struggling about your sat i hope you all get a good scores,positive
rensselaer polytechnic is such a gem of a school its a shame it wasnt even mentioned on this list after graduating my oldest went to microsoft and my second went to amazon both for software engineers my third has his foot in the door for jnj for chem eng they were average kids that got an incredible education as proven by their technical interviews i think you really need to mention rpi in more of your videos 3,positive
i’ve been watching since freshmen year heading into my senior year now i self studied with many tips from here and got a 1500 today thank you,positive
thanks for sharing i am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to since sat scores are all relative since i score a 1500 it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99 i think the part about scores being inflated because schools dont have to report bad test scores since students arent submitting bad tests scores makes sense however i do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the us world news report requires a school to report at least 50 of its students scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings thus more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots,positive
hi brooke great video as always quick question do you think the sat will serve of any relevance for students of the class of 2027 and beyond regards,positive
stay tuned for part 2 math section essay section soon subscribe so you dont miss our latest videos,positive
i’m actually kinda nervous cause i’m taking my sat tomorrow and did no studying whatsoever watching this give me some confidence thx,negative
not me watching this 8 hours before i take the test,negative
i got a 1420 with little preparation everyone here will be fine even if you don’t get the score you want life goes on,positive
i received a score of 1270 though it’s only a part of what the colleges are looking for in my case my high school grades steadily improved throughout the 4 years with my junior year ending in around 38 gpa and 40 gpa for my senior year i was accepted into 3 uc schools pennstate and a guaranteed transfer to boston university,positive
to be honest about this whole thing youre right you dont have to study the knowledge you accumulated from 9th to 1112th grade all you have to know are the tricks wealthy people pay just for this to the test and thats the only way possible to get a high score its like a very special system to weed out the people who cant afford to go to college i feel sorry for this because education should be affordable to all,negative
retaking it tomorrow got a 940 last time so let’s hope it goes well this time edit i got a 1070,positive
the guy who invented sats sounds like the type of kid to remind the teacher about the homework,negative
i’m surprised they didn’t mention how you have to pay to take the test seriously it’s one of the most obvious ways of why and how it measures family income over actual intelligence rich people can just take the test more,negative
so you’re telling me if this person didn’t had this weird fascination of ranging peoples intelligence into some kind of scalemeter format that i wouldn’t have to stress over sats so much,negative
the sat is still way easier than most other countrys entrance exams,positive
half the comments on this video are “lol you guys think the sat is hard wait til you learn about insert random country’s standardized test” the discussion surrounding this video shouldn’t be “mine is harder and therefore better” it should be about how bad standardized testing is and how it really isn’t a measure of intelligence just of taking the test,negative
all these people commenting im poor and i got a 1300 by studying a lot  we are talking about that poor people on average are less likely to get a great score not that its impossible there is a difference between inequality in general and a specific success story,negative
“low scores should never be a veto on a student’s life” that hit me hard,negative
full algebra playlist hope this helps with your review,positive
i pray for all of those who take sat to get a very good mark and everyone succeeds and goes to a good university ,positive
4 years of maths within 3 hour omg thank you,positive
before i get into my comment i would like to say thank you i really appreciate that fact that you take the time out of your own day making these incredible useful tiktok s and youtube videos so people can study even though your not making anything off of it back to the point id like to say thank you because right now i’m a freshman and i didn’t really have a motivation to study for the act but when i was scrolling through tik tok i saw a video with a really hard math problem but you made it seem really easy like i could do it in a minute so after that i did more research and found out how important the act really is so i’ve been studying with your youtube and tiktok videos along with other things on the side i still have 2 years before i have to take it but your videos are so entertaining they make me want to learn and get better at math,positive
im watching this the night before my satwe love procrastination,positive
i improved by 130 points on my sat and this was a big part of it thank you so much for making this video we all appreciate it and you,positive
you cant imagine the magnitude of my gratitude towards you thanks man,positive
i lowkey just started crying out of appreciation for u and all u do for us,positive
this is the some of the best math help i’ve ever found for the sat,positive
as junior year is stressful as it already is my man i want to thank you so much for helping me out i feel confident about the sat now,positive
im worried i cant do my sat on august tt any further more techniques please,negative
the biggest problem for me right now is that i’m working during the day i try to study from 7830 am but then i have to catch the bus to go to work at 10 and then i work until 4 but get home at 5 then i have to walk my dogeat dinner and can only start studying at 9 again but i wake up at 6 so it’s so hard to find time,negative
so excited that i graduated high school and i get to take the sat again because i want to transfer,positive
how can i get fee waiver for sat exam i complete class 12 in 2020 but not joined any college please say how can i get fee waiver,negative
a girl in my school just got accepted into yale with a full ride scholarship she deserves it and im so proud of her,positive
“yeah the sat is unnecessary” everyone proceeds to get 1500’s,negative
wow glad to see that yale students are so humble and friendly,positive
i just graduated from law school and attended washington u in st louis for my undergrad it is so interesting seeing all of these people a few years behind me talk about stats scores and extracurriculars yale and other elite schools can really and truly set you up for life but just remember if your scores aren’t this amazing or you don’t get into your dream school you still have a wonderful life ahead of you i’ve taken classes at community college public universities and private universities and your education really is what you make of it college is only a few years out of the rest of your life and i wish in high school i had known that and spent more time making memories and less time worried about my gpa just my two cents and amazing that all of these students are so accomplished at such young ages,positive
hey queen girl you have done it again constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly i’d say i’m surprised but i know who you are i’ve seen it up close and personal girl you make me so proud,positive
256 as an ib student the person who was predicted to get a 44— thats actually insanely impressive i would say much more so than the gpas thats a 4445 which means top marks on every exam but one plus top marks on other things like essays core to the program,positive
as fun as these videos are i do want to give a certain amount of warning to hs students just because you have the grades scores letters of rec essays and extracurriculars doesn’t mean you’ll be accepted into these schools i was denied to all of my colleges despite having a 38423 a 1490 and being on a nationally recognised robotics and rocketry team i even did robotics research in hs at a university applied to the university and then was denied from that university so much of it is just an arbitrary lottery it’s hard to truly know,negative
256 and 319 having a 44 ib predicted score is way more impressive than getting a 40 gpa we have a monster on our hands,positive
this is unknown territory for me its fascinating i dropped out of high school in 10th grade due to multiple reasons but mostly due to feeling overwhelmed and lost without any guidance im proud of these kids cause they dont all come from privilege they worked hard,positive
i like watching these videos cuz they do be inspiring me to continue my college education in highscool i was a 20 gpa student barely putting the effort to muster a c my only way getting into college was soccer but eventually i quit due to mental health i was really depressed and didn’t have any motivation for anything had no friends no job and overall i was in a bad state in hs i just turned 20 now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer but yeah would’ve wished i had better guidance and wished i could go back and change that so i wouldn’t have made it harder on myself i didn’t even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life starting to change now how i am now and it’s honestly making me a better person and happier seeing you guys so happy at yale is motivation and brings me joy you guys are very smart and i also admire your hard work you put in and the sacrifice,negative

all high school juniors hit the like button for good luck,positive
“the whole sat in general is a waste of time” finally someone said it,negative
honestly getting all the questions right is a quite impressive but getting all of them wrong is wayyy more impressive,positive
jehovah i pray that everyone watching this very helpful vid scores a 1500 on the upcoming sat amen,positive
i got a 1590 on my sat using strategies similar to the ones you recommend so this guy is legit y’all if you get anything out of this it’s to take the time to fully understand the passage the only caution i’d have with your strategies is to avoid any sort of generalizing as you did with finding the word that fits in context while that is the case most of the time i’ve seen collegeboard switch it up before they’re rude like that you’re killing it tho keep up the good content,positive
bro you are actually a god i just took the sat today and it went so well the only thing i did from my previous attempt in august is try using your strategy and my performance magically improved i swear i’ve spent so much time trying to improve i practiced over 3000 questions read prep books and studied under tutoring yet my score decreased every attempt through the past year however you were the only one who was able to help me only other channel is supertutor tv also this happened to be the last sat i could ever take since i’m a senior just wanted to say thank you so much,positive
you’re honestly the best sat resource that i’ve seen in a while like i have learned so much from just these couple of videos compared to watching sat tips from other bigger channels thank you for all the help and i really love your style of videos ps you’re gonna blow up soon i just know it cuz these videos are actually really informative,positive
ive got my test tomorrow thank you so much you know one of those times when the teachers teach you stuff but then your friend just explains it briefly and easily and you understand just better than the 1 hour looong session thats exactly how i felt anyways thanks again and wish me luck,positive
bro you didnt even just get a 1600 you got every single question right thats crazy,positive
whos taking it tomorrow lesss get it btw anna youre a great human being,positive
im taking my sat in a week and i watched all ur vids in one sitting thank u so much for this i appreciate you 33,positive
im just gonna be real with you if a question says delete the underlined portion as one of the choices 910 times deleting is the best option i never see them put that choice but it doesnt fit,negative
thank you so much you are helping thousands of people by uploading advice on how to be a smart test taker and using common sense to your advantage the main thing about the sat is staying calm and knowing what to do you are helping a lot with both of those,positive
i am giving the sats this saturday and when i say this i mean it this is by far the best video i have watched on the reading section the double trick worked so perfectly for me in the practice test may god bless you,positive
i watched all the videos in your playlist theyre very helpful you are one of those very few people that actually show something useful rather than bragging thank you ,positive
i’ve watched so many videos on sat studying tips but none have actually gone into detail usually just recommending sites to use all your videos have seriously helped thank you so much,positive
if youre taking the sat soon good luck,positive
you know the school system is bad when people are posting how to guess the answer to a question,negative
“primary definitions are almost always wrong” me nods and chooses the answer that says blend means to quietly assert,negative
i couldn’t do this i’d get anxiety and triple check the passage,negative
definitely a good sign that these tests are worth the paper they’re printed on when people are more focused on minmaxing time spent per question without even reading the passage as opposed to engaging with the content as it would’ve been covered in class way to go college board,positive
learn more in less time through my 6 hour sat math course for a perfect score use code first100 for a serious discount,positive

i got a 1500 on my sats i went to a community college got my associates transferred to a 4 year college did super well there went to school of medicine at uw and im almost done with my residency,positive
how the hell you get 2200 out 2400 and end up working at buzzfeed,negative
these people all got better scores than me i think the sat shows how well you can take a testnot how well you understand the subject im a terrible test taker,negative
no talking during the exam you all failed,negative
this is the entire problem with the sat system its not about the knowledge its the tricks in taking the exam things like sat prepping and all other things should not be encourage when taking it in real statistics term the results you get from taking the test are false because youve practice to jacked up your score,negative
they got high scores i got a 1800 and i thought i did good,positive
no way these sat scores were accurate 2300 out of 2400 yea okay someone doesnt know how the scoring works,negative
first of all let me clear up the misunderstanding about why asians do well in life we do not always send kids off to academic supplements sat study classes etc obviously there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go but there are a plethora that do just as well if not better on these types of activities sat act gpa school etc without any additional help aside from a practise test book from the local library that is me and i can affirm that for many asian kids we have an inherent need to do good make our parents proud no matter how much pressure we have and have a highlevel job and go to ivy league schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us we push for the best because of our work ethic not because all asians have oh so much money for the majority of our parents as immigrants it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour the hard work the exhaustion and the prejudice they have faced in the past all to provide their children with more opportunities it is not that asians are inherently smarter or richer or more privileged in any ways although there are those select few but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today asians are no different from others of ethnic origin to say mexicans africanamericans indians and other disprivileged minorities in the states the only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end i am not trying to start up any racial slurs cursing or insultations of any kind just putting out a thought and consideration for you all obviously there are many successful talented and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones but i am just making a point here why would the highlevel universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of racial preference or racial advantage note i put that in quotations meaning i myself do not think that is a fact there are hardworking and lazy people smart and ignorant good and bad in any race it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public so tell me why should one race get more sympathy or preference over another can we not just all be equal human beings it is like saying red is better than pink why oh because it is true without an explanation so what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade chinese girl and i wanted to share the truth to everyone thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully we can all start changing society little by little with messages like this no enmities i hope,positive
full algebra playlist hope this helps with your review,positive
can we just appreciate my guy sitting there for 35 hours and making this video thanks a lot for the help man,positive

i just felt such a rush of emotions and just appreciation for you as soon as you told me about the time stamps the dedication and commitment you have to providing us with the best chance to succeed is truly admiring thank you  ,positive

thank you for all your advice tomorrow is my big day so fingers crossed ,positive
perfect timing i was just about to look for some last minute tips for my test tomorrow ,positive

im a junior whos trying to get a 1470 on the sat this year i took it last year and got a 930 i have to study like hell,negative
you got a 1310 on your very first try that’s crazy,positive

watching this as a senior is too late lol  please don’t procrastinate like i did study a lot,negative
hey you if youre reading this and youre about to take the sat i just wanna say youre gonna do great if you want more motivation if you wanna be hyped up a lil more keep reading while i was studying for my sats i kept telling myself this is the only thing thats academically important to do that is secluded from school meaning that there are no teachers or classmates to hinderinterrupt your learning this test is 100 the amount of effort you put in so thats just really something to think about while youre going into this test i wish you all the best 3,positive
idk if everyone has access to khan academy but that helps too and provides practice,positive
can we get a video on how a company that sucks so much money out of students is supposed to be nonprofit,negative
so 4 mistakes in math takes you down to 710the things people do for money,negative
so i took the sat practice test 10 right i usually score 13601400 on a practice test i make a total of 5 mistakes on the math section on a bad day which is what happend usually it will translate to a score of 730740 i did pretty well on reading 3352 and writing 4044 sections im excited to calculate my score and then i see the horrific truth 4044 in writing is translated to 330 70 points deducted for 4 wrong answers 3352 is translated to 280 fine 5358 is translated to 710 90 points deducted for 5 wrong answers a total of 1320 even though i did exteramly good in the writing section just above averge in reading which is a totally flawed section but thats another topic and amazing in the math section i got a just above average score that gives me no chance hypothetically to get into my dream school am i a joke to you,positive
thank you for your video could you arrange a video for the international students application for scholarships where are the official dependable web sites the requirements everythings,positive
i remember a few years back i got a single question wrong on the psat reading section and it dropped me three points out of the 38 possible explain to me how its not curved,negative
the fact that they don’t score on a curve is a completely lie and was contradicted in the video what do u call saying that one test is harder than another so they can get more wrong even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating this is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar and even though this may be harder for the english section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a curve because there is no other word for what ur doing,negative
everyone reading this message for september 26th lets get those 1500 scores update it worked i got a 1550,positive

these people are not high school students they have forgotten some stuff even then the 670 average is a lot higher than the national average of 528 as you have claimed this is more than 1 standard deviation from the mean and almost 2 standard deviations i would think this concludes that chinese people are on average good in sat maths instead of looking at a fixed cutoff score of 700 and concluding that they are not that good,negative

ive been tutoring the sat for 29 years this version of the test is the fourth version i have taught im very happy with this videos emphasis on quality studying over cramming and using actual sat questions the stressing of analyzing your wrong answers to see how you could get a question similar to it correct in the future is exactly how to go about it i have an important side note the fact that a student needs to do all this prep just because the test is a mass of eccentricities is one of many indicators of just how bogus the sat really is,positive
love this taking mine aug 29 so definitely came at the right time,positive
i’m currently using the sat prep black book and it has helped me a lot i never would have gotten one if it weren’t for your recommendation thank you ,positive

also remember if you got a good sat score but want a better chance at earning merit scholarships grants apply to some schools that accept lower sat scores than you have you have a much better chance at earning great merit scholarships vs at top schools where youll be competing with a lot more people with similar scores thats what i did and ill be graduating debtfree from my university save that money for grad school or buying a house,positive

thank you for the info im a brazilian student struggling if its worth applying to the us i did a indepth research some “mock” sat’s at home and have a strong sympathy for certain american colleges education structure as compared to brazilian or european universities which im fortunate to have the citizenship in both places nevertheless if i do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years i’d have to eliminate one of my options whether usp in brazil or epfl in switzerland due to the amount of time set into both while balancing my studies for the local admissions testfuvestusp the epfl’s entrance exams in french and a few ec’s i obtained a couple of 1550 scores at home following all the procedures as timemonitored tests i judge my english as nearfluent since i have been taking classes since i was 9 above all i have a strong passion for physics mathematics and technologiesmainly ai related to physics research i also would be prone to take sat ii and possibly ap exams as well as the toefl to sum up with my 96 out of 10 gpa my main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest math or physics with computer science i have participated weekly in two educational nfos since i was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work some calls and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher which i loved i had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until i started piano lessons one year ago i have been taking english and french private lessons for 4 years and played varsity statelevel soccer being the captain until the pandemic started i acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live i life i wont regret however i awfully believe that my extracurriculars arent good enough for top 20 schools and im inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education but entirely different from what ive expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that i also have in history and art back to my financial means im entirely grateful for the opportunities that i already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of 25000 per year from my parents by converting my mother’s income to usd35000 we would qualify for 100 financial support from needbased universities and those would be my goals my question is am i a strong applicant for america’s a1 universities undergrad or have i lost my chance by not investing in a passion project,positive
in my sophmore year of high school there was a korean girl who spoke no english used a translator machine for the whole year and she would put the questions into the machine and she still managed to finsh first and get the highest grade out of all of us she told me american test so easy like dancing i cant dance either,negative

truly inspiring video the presentation is truly flawless and the few frames of minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game i love how you used pocket edition because its unique and different than most minecraft videos being published today using pc or console versions of the game and i really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles i really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding if you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay we can find that the player is holding a torch just like the many around his shelter this means the torches around the base has just been placed and shows how you can move forward in life no matter how dire the situation may seem in the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning showing how even if someone is in their home they are never safe of the dangers outside and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety i also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls not to mention the way the player looks out the exit as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there and how even though you may be small compared to the universe the impact you make can change the world another very symbolic part of this film is the ending where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the players dedication it also is in a slightly smaller frame and black bars replace the outer edges which show that even though you try your best there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey and how much different it could have been if you have done something different which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of minecraft as long as possible without itching ones testicles the background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt blue or sad about ending but still proud of what they accomplished and is hopeful for what is to come a really poetic performance really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls i cant wait to see more work from you 1010 simply phenomenal,positive
chandlers face at the end was priceless ,positive
one of the best thing about this dude is that he never takes creadat for him self when he achieve something he allows respect us,positive

when you have a two three four tier justice system things like this happen and criminals run rampant,negative
i can tell you why trump filed it with this judge in particular he thinks every judge he appointed owes him for that and will overlook their oath to help him out if this judge says no he will call her a rino and appeal it with another judge as for why now he is hoping he can stall the investigation,negative
i love the judges why did you come to me because trump appointed you and trump expects loyalty and bias in his favor,positive
he needed the documents because deutsche bank doesnt believe hes as rich as he says he is they flat out refused to take eric as collateral,negative
he’s had them for 18 months there’s no way of ever knowing who saw them or photographed them until they surface somewhere in the world it’s the most dangerous action he did coz of course he will have shownsoldused them for leverage,negative
seven hundred documents each one for sale for 50 million each can be quite a nice retirement fund remember trump has always been a transactional person and what he figures is his he feels perfectly in the right to sell to give as a gift for some favor,positive
you know things are desperate when your furniture starts to resemble an oceangoing vessel im glad they were found by the cruise ship but did the cruise ship really have to make them handpaddle their way aboard,negative

of course they do what else do you expect from liars,negative
the federal government guarantees the education loans the lending institution and the universitycollege are not liable for any of the loans thats the problem,negative
this is great for some people but you really need to regulate the actual universities who are charging absurd amounts and thatll get lobbied against hard by college corporations,negative
remember it’s only federal loans and those parents with less than stellar credit scores could not get federal loans,negative
just 40 or 45 years ago going to university in america was free then corporate america took advantage of the educational system the problem is the educational system in america if you are a middle class or poor families going to university in america is a lifetime debt,negative
it’s the interest that compounds that becomes a problem puts graduate in a financial prison for years i paid my student loans and i support debt relief it was hard to pay of 10k because of interest,negative
student loans should be dischargeable or modifiable in bankruptcy proceedings based on a proper showing of financial hardship it is absurd that the credit card debt on a spring break trip to cancun is unquestionably dischargeable by a bankruptcy court but tuition housing and fees for college are not,negative
im 67 a war veteran and i am watching my country being driven off a cliff in a clown car filled with conspiracy nut jobs terrific,negative
forget about the evidence said no innocent individual ever more importantly his denial of democracy and proper judicial process is unfathomable,negative
the pillow guy screaming forget about the evidence thats all you need to know about him and his followers,negative
pretty difficult to change the opinions of people whose opinions dont require evidence especially not by presenting evidence to the contrary,negative
“no just forget about the evidence” the gqp have swallowed that bs hook line and sinker,negative
i remember when sidney powell said there were so many votes for trump it broke the algorithm i felt my iq drop when she said that i suspect several people developed actual brain cancer as a result,negative
these fears and conspiracies really thrive in darkness spot on i find a lot of people that fall for this stuff simply dont bother to seek answers for the questions that they have they keep themselves in the dark on purpose,negative
perfect defense for a bank robber your honor my client was just taking the money to a more secure location,negative
“word is lots truth is none” lmao absolutely humbled,positive
as someone with the correct clearance i can vouch just like so many of you that this guy didnt keep them in a place that meets requirements for storage of such materials also lying about all this is quick dismissal from your clearance ive seen people fail to get adjudicated for omission of one piece of information they thought wasnt important one lost it for keeping in touch with their mother who is from china their contact with their mother caused them to lose their tssci think about that and this guy and his followers think he did nothing wrong the level of failures here by the former president shows he is illequipped to handle said documents now its just one excuse after another day to day with the people who live in the real world of clearance all know that if we did 1 of what he did we be effed time to put your values you claim into action republicans dont claim it only when its convenient,negative
if all documents leaving the oval office were automatically declassified then there should at least be a record of which documents were removed otherwise anyone could take anything out and it would be declassified with no notice but it´s just the same old game first excuse it falls apart so second excuse also falls flat so next excuse something is wrong if you have to change your explanation again and again cause they were proven wrong again and again,negative
“roughly as safe as…” as a 27 year military officera jag attorney now a judge that ridiculous slimy phrase sets my teeth on edge it’s like saying a honda civic hatchback is the same as a mercedes s class sedan because they both have 4 wheels ,negative

“he took his work home” best line ever ,positive
whats in the box anderson cooper just killed me,negative
where do they find these people ive sadly thought that everyday for 6 years,negative
this might be the time to track down all these threats and show some real consequences to the people that issue them or incite others to issue them this has to stop,negative
the people that are making the threats need to be locked up,negative
every single person that is found making threats or inciting this nonsense needs to be held accountable these brainwashed clowns are really willing to throw their lives away for a man that could care less about them on any level,negative
if i called for the posting of the home address of the judge who signed a warrant for me id be in cuffs for interfering with an official investigation and obstruction of justice before the media ever found it,negative
just stunning that the party once proud of standing with the military and for law and order just voted against helping veterans and now shows disrespect and distain for the law and those who serve shame on them,negative
these are dark days when an individual can cause this much damage to a country,negative
i’ll never forget the devastating story of the judge who’s information was posted online and consequently her teenaged son was murdered when he answered the door at their home this is not acceptable,negative
whatever happened to the communicating a threat charge and now that its against the fbi you have to charge these people regardless if you feel if its meaningless or not when have the fbi been afraid to arrest people making death threats what has happened to our government,negative
218 all the violent talk is dangerous because even the flippant stuff goads along the people who do finally take violent action it must all be considered serious real threats,negative
in canada threats of any kind especially death threats are a chargeable offense,negative
when someone finally says something on tv that you can’t even say on the internet anymore  wish this happened more often,positive
interesting interview its incredible how discussion turn more and more intense and how roger gave his answers,positive
respect to roger waters he looks at the root of the cause and not what the media feeds,positive
this is what we need more of people from different views talking it out and hearing what the other has to say and even if it gets heated they can both shake hands in the end and see the others as equals too often nowadays nobody wants to hear what the otherside has to say they just want to shut it down by saying that their side is better than the other and nothing more,negative
this is literally the 1st time i have watched anything from cnn in maybe 10 years,positive
the interviewer looks naive to me when he can’t argues with waters he just avoids it by laughing,negative
感谢您敢于说出事实与真相，在这种充斥着耀眼的环境之中仍然保持您自己独立的思考，敢于发表自己的观点和意见，非常感谢您，roger waters先生！,positive
“this is my message strangers passing in the street by chance two separate glances meet and i am you and what i see is me” wow,positive
its always refreshing to hear great minds cutting through the bs and everyday talking points of the propaganda machines and handing them their ass on a plate hats off to you sir,positive
i have more respect for roger than for any other living human being,positive
he was reckless with documents people used to have to tape them back together from the trash can but i never known him to destroy documents what in the actual fuck this guy is a lawyer lmao,negative
you just said he would throw documents away and at the end of the night people would have to go through the trashcans and dig documents out and tape them back together and then you said you dont believe he would destroy and documents so which is it,negative
love how everyone becomes lawyers,positive
his demeanor says it all,positive
“any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never will be “ thomas jefferson,negative

with so many pot smokers now they should let the people in prison on weed related charges out,negative
so 23rds of americans support legal pot but the federal government still says its illegal thanks for representing the will of the people,negative
tobacco is almost all downsides and weed is almost all upsides hard to imagine anyone would prefer tobacco to cannabis,negative
thats a good thing and honestly its probably been that way for a while just that some people didnt fess up to it while it was illegal in their state plus some people get their nicotine fix from non tobacco sources now anyway which wasnt really a thing until the past decade and a half,positive
am a boomer and have smoked weed for over 40 years some people my age arent always truthful about whether they smoke or not,negative
makes a positive change cannabis needs to be federally legalized needed tax dollars,positive
more people use weed than tobacco ive waited all my life to see those words im so proud of all of us way to go,positive
a people that elect corrupt politicians imposters thieves and traitors are not victims but accomplices george orwell,negative
the question of whether to indict prosecute a former president is irrelevant and immaterial if hes guilty hes guilty,negative
647 lets fight crime by prosecuting whiny orange politicians who got taped asking the attorney general in the state of georgia to find them 11780 votes,negative
do it right and make sure it sticks but let’s not take forever to do it,positive
the question of who committed the crime is immaterial that is starting from a wrong premise and does not conform to justice principles in this investigation rather the question should be was a crime committed what crime had been committed and what does the law say about committing such a crime then justice should follow the law does not say unless such a person is a former president,negative
france israel and south korea have charged and in two cases convictedone is still pending current or former heads of state in the last 5 years both of the convictions led to prison sentences it hasnt damaged those countries they arent banana republics all this handwringing is pointless if any citizen is to have any faith at all left in the us justice system these crimes need to be charged regardless of the culprit,negative
the most significant question of our time is the president of the united states above the law how the doj answers that will determine if democracy fails in america,negative

i don’t understand aren’t we all for “law and order” and “no one is above the law” it seems to me that the doj and fbi should investigate anyone that might have done anything that a normal person like us would be investigated for and possibly go to jail all corrupt politicians should be investigated regardless of party,negative

this guy is an insufferable weasel stop inviting him to speak,negative
its interviews like this that give people like him legitimacy when they dont deserve any giving a platform to dishonesty is not balance or equity,negative
nobody is asking why did trump need to take any of these documents how is it mulvaney is focused on procedure impropriety and confidence in rhe fbi and not wondering why after months they resorted to going thru all these steps undoubtedly they ask pretty please for at least 6 months another example of the best people,negative
if the president ripped up a document we taped it back togetheri never saw the intentional destruction of documents i saw documents handled in the ordinary course of business they might be defaced we fixed them how is ripping up a document considered to be in the ordinary course of business hes admitted that they were defaced,negative

if the market is so heavily effected by a tweet then it isnt based in reality a home gallons of gas or milk etc are always in demand and you cant say the price doubled because of economics why do economy dynamics always favor the rich the prices never fall when the current crisis is over not significantly,negative
people were saying there would be a housing cash there are companies buying up home to turn owning a home into a business pricing regular people out of buying a house there is a shortage of homes and las vegas i havent seen the prices go down greedy companies are pricing renters out of the ability to find a place to rent,negative
part of the problem is millions sold their homes to large companies like black rock instead of to actual families those type of companies want money so they jack up the rent and never sell those homes to families i know everyone want money but think twice about selling your home to those companies every time you do you prevent other families from being able to afford a home and subject them to outrageous rent prices i speak from experience,negative
so its basically greed got it theres too much money out there lets change that,negative
that is a load of crap the reason rents are going up is corporations buying up rentals houses apartment buildings and then escalating the rent to make money mortgage rates are not that high look what they were under reagan 185 now that was high,negative

all president trump had to do was give the fbijustice department all of those documents that they wanted the first time that he got a subpoena and there wouldnt be all of this drama right now once again he creates problems and then blames others when they have to clean up his mess,negative
for once hold this crook accountable lock him up ,negative
i had a tssci clearance when i was in the air force i had to go into a special facility called a “scif” that was under 24 hour armed guard etc to even have access to that type of information unbelievable,negative

can we now say lock him up,negative

making falsehoods to the public like the ones he is spouting need to be made illegal with steep punishments this is not exercising free speech he and his filthy ignorant supporters have no qualms about creating more societal chaos with their abject lies this practice needs to be brought to an end,negative

its disgusting and horrifying that there are people walking around like this especially if hes aspiring to be in any position of power,negative
as a former military officer myself i cannot fathom how sabatini ever passed a background check let alone became an infantry officer his actions and comments are a classic example of conduct unbecoming of an officer he needs to resign from the national guard before he destroys its reputation,negative
as another viewer from outside it’s quite appalling that people vote for such crazy and dangerous people the issue with protecting the right to talk absolute nonsense is that there are a significant number of people who are simply not smart enough to recognise it,negative
they know full well what they are doing theyve shown repeatedly that they dont care about the constitution or laws that hold them accountable laws are for everyone else they are just pulling everyones leg its simply and literally a game to them thats what abusers do,negative

apparently he forgot the oath he took when he signed up for his service,negative
i disagree and heres what i think the real problem islegitimate law firms with good reputations dont want to be remembered as the agency who represented benedict donald,negative
the trouble is that this man hit the nail on the head when he said that he would find it inappropriate to become part of a team attempting to tear down the justice system you could start off with the best of intentions but in no time at all you would find yourself standing in shit up to your neck there is no way of working with trump and doing it right forget it,negative
well we know he has one attorney that has had to go to jail for him another attorney who is about to be indicted and another attorney testifying in front of the january 6th committee so i think its safe to say that most smart attorneys are not going to think that representing this man is worth it plus they know they wont get paid,negative
it turns out that competent lawyers wont actually sit in front of a federal judge and lie for you,negative
i would have to give up all of my other clients yes code for he does not want to be disbarred like rudy no honest lawyer can defend pos 45,negative
one of the saddest lessons of history is this if we’ve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle we’re no longer interested in finding out the truth the bamboozle has captured us it’s simply too painful to acknowledge even to ourselves that we’ve been taken once you give a charlatan power over you you almost never get it back carl sagan,negative

he lost me at it makes us look like extremist democrats why the hell can these people not respond to a direct question about their behavior without trying to deflect to democratsi agree with ms claire what is he talking about if a democrat was doing what trump was doing what would he say and do take some bloody responsibility,negative
there are ways to resolve that issue yeah like not stonewalling the national archives for a year and a half or signing a sworn affidavit that youve returned all the records when its a blatant lie,negative
how many people out there would have several months to comply with felony related inquiries to keep you out of prison even one chance to provide these documents is one more than any one else would have been given,negative
you know what trips me out is that instead of just taking responsibility these political hacks point out when the other side did it and pointing fingers instead of being a normal adult and just take responsibility,negative

since arriving in the senate in 2011 ron johnson has repeatedly backed policies that would leave veterans out in the cold including voting against expanded healthcare job training and educational opportunities for those who have served in uniform ron johnson’s record makes clear that he has not served in the senate with the best interests of wisconsin veterans in mind,negative

personally i think education or specifically a lack thereof is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this because ignorance breeds fear and distrust especially in things that are new or foreign when i was in elementary school back in the 70s i was reading my way through my schools scifi section it was just a few shelves but it had almost all the classics asimov bova bradbury campbell clarke doc smith heinlein and then i got to verne id just finished up 30000 leagues and was getting into journey to the center of the earth when i found a page had been ripped from the book being a good student i reported it to the librarian but instead of focusing on the missing page she was outraged that i was reading this particular book it was above my level she said and too difficult for me this was a hundredyearold story at this point and i was pretty sure it wasnt a difficult one to follow the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on creature feature on saturdays but she still took the book away and over the next few weeks that scifi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there a short time later i overheard her talking to another teacher about of all things a shooting star a meteor that many had seen a night or two before the librarian was mocking the teacher because a shooting star is impossible the heavens are permanent the stars dont move as the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor it seemed to both terrify and outrage her and the longer that conversation went on the more even i maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time realized the scifi books she had removed werent above my level they were above her level she had no understanding of science and all these scifi stories about starships robots and alien worlds were things that she just didnt understand and because of that they scared her so she locked them away and unfortunately it sounds like that sort of mindset hasnt changed all that much in the 40 or so years since then,negative
whenever i heard a book was banned from my school library i would immediately check it out from the public library i learned a lot about menstruation from “dear god it’s me margaret” one summer i was 8 and completely traumatized when i realized it happens to my mom too i’m not helping here… my point being more students will now read these books than before banning them,negative
when one parent doesnt want their child to read a certain book they can fill out a form so no child in the school can read it that sounds more like indoctrination than education instead of removing the book from the whole school they should just disallow that one student access to the book sorry johnny you cant check out that book because your parents said so,negative
i’m a pubic school teacher this is part of the reason that there is a shortage of qualified teachers teachers are just sick and tired of being sick and tired they are finding jobs where they are respected,negative

first sentence and he started to liedid not do this mistake on purpose so out of accident he reported on this matter over the course of 5 years numerous times but it wasnt intentional he just asked questions and ohhe lied over and over and over again this guy will never admit his wrongs morally compromised he is nothing else,negative
theres no accounting at his business irs are you listening how could this possibly be true,negative

alex jones defense might actually be brilliant i didnt do it on purpose look at the lawyer he hired sent the prosecution all the evidence they needed i didnt do it on purpose he lied under oath i didnt do it on purpose i mean hes clearly guilty of torturing the victims of an elementary school shooting his choosen defense is the only option that had at least a 1 chance of working but ultimately him hiding his own money so he can declare bankruptcy defense is much stronger the old white man defense,negative
the company “had no accounting dept” how is that possible,negative

trump and adonis are the last two words i would have expected to hear in a sentence even today i agree with the first statement saying biden could defend himself but i dont think everyone would look at the email and see it as a sermon setting someone straight and telling them what they did was unexpected and improper isnt a sermon its giving them a wakeup call also yes no physician should ever pass judgement like that without examining a person first its not rude its unprofessional he basically flaunted his status as a dr to troll inb4 trump tweets bi im fabulous,negative

i love how you actually explain stuff instead of just shoving information into students heads i think that turns many students off about learning chemistry since theyre not understanding any of it and are just blindly memorising and accepting that things happen the way they do without aksing why if those students had you as a teacher theyd be a much more interested in chemistry as theyll understand that its how we as a species study matter and the universe and is not just a bunch of stuff to be memorised keep going youre amazing 3,positive
sir as an older woman who found chemistry to be impossible when i was at school i thank you for this,positive

if you liked the video and want to see more like this here are some things you can do to make sure it happens  share the video  check out nebula curiosity stream  like and comment,positive
having done a lot of diving i can say that the octopus is an absolute marvel to encounter some mostly the younger ones are so curious at first its like wow u threat once it establishes that you are not its like eeer what are you then ive never seen one of you around before and there begins the act of mutual curiosity 3 you slowly reach with a finger it sends a tentacle you both touch sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand flashing black before letting go but not swimming away they are playful find a shiny pebble hand it to the octopus itll take it check if it can be eaten discard it then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to why did he give me this pebble gotta check again for anything special they really hold a very special place in my heart its not everyday that two species get curious about one another and attempt mutual understanding,positive
my favorite creature ever i was on a crab ship in russia i was the green horn so i had to empty out the pots i was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden it was lighting in a cup so i could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals one day there was an octopus in a crab pot i tossed it a live well came back once everyone was off the deck was gonna take it to the chef it softly wrapped itself around my arm and i felt like i could see the fear in its eyes i couldnt do it i took it over to the side of the ship held it over it looked down looked back at me let go of my arm and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water amazing creatures,positive
i can genuinely say i have never been more astounded by another being on this planet the evolution of this beautiful creature is literally out of this world this video left such an imprint on me that being able to pet play handle or be in close graces of this animal are on my lifes bucketlist for sure being apart of research and doing a 180 degree career change may be in my future,positive
you know in our hunt for intelligent life in space its heartwarming and humbling to know there are other creatures on this planet other than humans who very well in the distant future could eventually be seen as a higher intelligence,positive
one of the most amazing species of octopus is the mimic octopus it not only uses its shape changing skin and camouflage to hide but also imitates other sea life both as a way to escape predators when being chased by a damselfish itll make itself look like a banded sea snake which is a damsel fish predator but also to hunt imitating a crab to draw in another crab the list of animals its been observed to imitate is quite long jelly fish lionfish sea snakes zebra sole flatfish giant crab sea horses ect it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we dont know about the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals,positive
i feel that this is a great place to recommend the book children of ruin it depicts a society of octopuses that were subject to a virus which causes accelerated evolution and the struggle of humans to communicate with them some of the best scifi ive read,positive
i love how wired always finds people that are super passionate about their careers always the icing on the cake for me,positive
i love this guy hes so charismatic has wonderful speech patterns and explains things so well,positive
as a biology major this video made me feel sad for not having great professionals as passionate to their jobs as this man,negative
his enthusiasm is so contagious and he makes biology sound so interesting this was awesome thank you wired,positive
i love the way he talks with such enthusiasm but in a calm way that’s inviting and makes you want to learn,positive
this man brought half of his office with him just to show us the most details so humble and kind,positive
this guy is so fascinating i love him he’s so passionate about what he teaches and i love it i’m sure his students are so grateful for him he showed us so much cool stuff,positive
thor used to give talks at my tiny little elementary school in the pnw genuinely one of the smartest and most passionate people i have ever met in my life and yes he brought this many props for presentations too,positive
this dude needs a podcast his voice is calming and intellectual at the same time,positive
im allergic to penicillin and azithromycin round of applause for the parents,negative
people i just don’t think people should be able to use it for cosmetic purposes scientists bold of you to assume we know how to do that,negative
his body language says a lot about him hes very ambitious willing to share and learn more but also hes really competitive,positive
hello youtubers the world science festival is looking for enthusiastic translation ambassadors for its youtube translation project to get started all you need is a google account check out quantum biology the hidden nature of nature to see how the process works to create your translation just type along with the video and save when done check out the full list of programs that you can contribute to here the world science festival strives to cultivate a general public thats informed and awed by science thanks to your contributions we can continue to share the wonder of scientific discoveries with the world,positive
the number of times ive heard we dont know and partially understood gives me hope for science,positive
this is amazing and really interesting i got so lost because i have insufficient scientific education to follow this completely but it is fascinating to me and i really enjoyed this video i have saved it and will play it over and over again to try and understand it i love the humor and the very clear way they are trying to explain this to the layman it is wonderful that they have this on youtube so we can all explore this amazing subject,positive
i just want to say that i absolutely love this im both mindblown entertained and inspired as a mere psych student i still feel like i understood a whole lot of it and they even made some psych references and the way they talked about children having an intuitive understanding of quantum stuff made me think of theorytheory and this quote its not that children are little scientists — its that scientists are big children,positive
this was a phenomenally moderated session serious kudos to john,positive
i am very thankful for this presentation i was afraid i was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move in a since chemically that would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light in effect just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving its structure idle at its point of origin but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parents original quality in this accomplishing the quantum speeds said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction as well as color change we see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic plant cells great discussion,positive
i just started enjoying watching this with closed captioning but 20 minutes in it stopped working i hope this can be fixed so i can watch the whole segment absolutely loved what was mentioned already so far thank you all for putting this together,positive
thank you so much for this video very helpful for a biology teacher like me,positive
i remember being only able to see content like this on the discovery channel its crazy that i can watch content like this arguably waaay better at anytime and not being glued to my tv brilliant,positive
i use to be in the army i can remember in training the endless patrols through the woods but the dragonflies were our friends you’d see them gliding back and forth just over our heads catching the mosquitoes which swarmed around us it was impossible for the dragonflies to get all the mosquitoes but it was a comfort to know we had allies out there in those woods,positive
i once was kayaking with my father in florida when i took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore about 12 seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off after it decapitated my new found friend it took off with the body leaving the head sitting on my ore with my jaw on the floor in total shock of what murder i had just witnessed that day i learned that dragon flies are metal as fuck,negative
that was probably one of the more intelligent clicks ive chosen in a while thank you for sharing and creating that incredible video now i absolutely have an even deeper appreciation for dragonflies than i already did ,positive
i once found a cold dragonfly who couldnt move i put it into diret sunlight and it warmed and flew away im glad to have been of help,positive
this was one of the best documentaries i’ve ever seen perfect organization perfect visuals extremely high information content… well done and thank you,positive
when i was growing up in the countryside in japan dragonflies were everywhere i could catch them with my fingers sometimes of course i let them go quickly but some of the kids put thread on them so they wouldnt fly away those were the days now i dont see many dragonflies anymore thank you so much for sharing the wonderful fact about them,positive
ive seen a dragon fly with 6 wings once i was floating down a river and it was flying near me and then landed on me for a short time all of the wings worked a cool mutation i wonder how rare it is wish i had a camera with me,positive
what intelligence to be able to skillfully control those beautiful wings about 22 years ago my husband and i stopped by a large creek to meditate as i opened my eyes a group of five dragonflies that were traveling over the water suddenly stopped in front of my face hovered there for about 10 seconds then suddenly did a 90 degree turn in synchronized fashion and continued on their way down the creek it was otherworldly i’ll never forget it thank you for this excellent content,positive
the counterbalance to deal with aerodynamic flutter is some really incredible biomechanics ive seen videos of flutter being tested on airplanes and its no joke that can quickly ruin your day,negative
with the current acceleration of breakthroughs in science i wish this was like a monthly thing it would be awesome to get updated by these great videos,positive
truly interesting to learn that sleep isnt restricted to organisms with a brain,positive
quanta magazine always does a brilliant job at condensing scientific discoveries for a wider audience i love what you do,positive
i was waiting for this this blew my mind gotta wait for the physics and math one there are so much to tell great work,positive
i’ve been keeping my eyes on my subscriptions just in case quanta magazine posts this year’s science break through and it’s finally here great episode as usual i’m also excited for the maths and physics ones and thank you quanta magazine for your great work,positive
i just completed my first year if psychology and neuroscience at university scientists are learning new things about the brain all the time it’s super cool,positive
and if you haven’t had enough ocean creature facts for one day head over to listen to our new podcast episode “deciphering the mind of the octopus” on nebula it will take you behind the scenes on what it’s like to take care of these mischievous animals this is probably my favorite episode yet,positive
the most fearsome predator of the sea sharks the orca literally torturing other animals for fun am i a joke to you,negative
that footage of the finless shark plummeting to the sea floor was appalling im incredibly glad you showed it but its appalling im not outright against the killing of animals but the combination of outright cruelty and waste is just mind bending i struggle with how humans can so easily disconnect from certain realities i struggle with how i see it in myself as well a fisherman would know that these sharks would still be alive when theyre thrown back in if they just stopped to even think about what theyre doing if theyre hellbent on wasting the rest of the shark just slit the damn things throat before you throw it back you sick fuck,negative
it’s really interesting to think about how an animal that has been around for literally million of years just out of the blue made a species so different from the rest and out of the ordinary yet it ended up being very complex and enhanced from the norm,positive
awesome work love the video thank you for what you do,positive
hammerheads are amazing years ago while trolling off the coast of florida i encountered one i was headed due south and we spotted it heading aproximately se fin out the surface big fella but we were on an intercept course he came to within 100 ft of the boat then turned off to the west he circled around well behind our baits and resumed his original course i swear he had gps,positive
your speech at the end of this video really struck me it makes me so happy to hear someone able to take their dream and make it a reality both your channel and real engineering are two of my favorites for interesting and niche technology and science and i am always excited to see a new video thank you for being you and sharing what you care about to the rest of the world,positive
the technical side of this video and this channel is truly impressive have to admit the fact they are providing free useful scientific information with such a great quality a very big thanks for the people behind this channel ,positive
check out even more from thor,positive
every time he answers its like hes telling us a story rather than regurgitating an answer i could listen to him all day,positive
give this guy his own animal documentary series like a more chill bill nye his explanations are like a little story and you dont make anyone feel bad about their questions bravo this was one of the most entertaining biology videos i have watched in awhile,positive
came for the biology facts stayed for his infectious positivity his energy alone is more of a dopamine hit than anything else has been all day,positive
how on earth does wired get the professionals who are literally the most passionate people on the planet,negative
he seems very passionate about biology the way that he explains these things makes it seem like he really loves his job i admire people who can be passionate about their jobs,positive
not only is he crazy passionate and knowledgeable about biology hes also called thor how much cooler can this guy get,positive
the plant is deadly deadly toxic d lmao i love this guy his enthusiasm is contagious keep bringing him back,positive
he is the type of biology teacher that would be able to easily hold the attention of any classe just by the way he speaks so excited about things,positive
as someone obsessed with biology im pretty disappointed that the map of biology received the least views of all the sciences,negative
ive been waiting forever for this one although im biased by being a biochemist myself he did an amazing job at bringing all the branches together in a smooth nonconfusing way i would like to see a map of medicine or linguistics in the future,positive
awesome job with this maps and all the others too which will be the next map map of philosophy map of engineering map of psychology,positive
this is helping me understand what parts of biology i like and therefore helping me choose my education thank you for a very informational video,positive
i love your maps they are fantastic thank you for putting them together they are super helpful one nitpick what about microbiology this is a very important subject given that unicellular microorganisms vastly outnumber the multicellular organisms most people are familiar with of course i may be biased since i am a microbiologistanyway keep up the great work i am blown away by the breadth of your knowledge and have learned a ton about scientific fields i am less familiar with through your work,positive
love the kurzgesagt reference at 302 can you do the map of astronomy next,positive
i love these maps so much they are pure gold philosophy i imagine is very tough to make but would be extremly awesome too,positive
these videos are good but i have two minor criticisms of this one 1 structural biology is concerned with the structure of large macromolecules amino acids are all small molecules so they fall more under the purview of biochemistry your description is almost verbatim one of the sentences from the opening paragraph of the wikipedia page on structural biology but i dont think thats correct 2 biomedical engineering is the field that makes artificial organs and other medical devices biotechnology uses living organisms or their products for our purposes synthetic biology creates synthetic organisms and is closely related to biotechnology but the latter two fields arent closely related to the first,negative
this dude is getting me through college one video at a time,positive
my earphones get tangled all the time but miles and miles of dna dont mind blowing,negative
i started teaching biology in 1993 and i know my kids now middle aged know it was rosalind franklin who did the work hank thank you i left teaching but am thinking about getting back into the classroom using your videos to study up for the test to get recertified,positive
thank you so much for covering rosalind franklin some of my previous instructors only briefly mention her and they rarely discuss her major contributions to the discovery of the dna structure,positive
why is a teenage boy similar to helicase they both want to unzip your genes grins im speechless,negative
i dont remember crash course being this complicated when i was in 9th grade biology though i guess i should be thankful that 6 years later it is still helpful for my college level genetics class,positive
editing team hank please hold up a shoelace and be amazed by it,positive
for the first time in my two years in college i actually understand what i am seeing thank you i am in the mlt program trying to understand how pcr testing works but in order to do that i realized that i really need to comprehend dna and how it is made in order to understand how it is taken apart and analyzed you have really given me a strong visual and i cant thank you enough,positive
honestly its crazy how much easier information is retained when you voluntarily seek it when i was in school i would have never listened to this and would have been dying to get out of there now that i have the ability to learn on my own time i retain and look for information on a much higher level incredible,positive
this professor is wonderful i’ve been in a lot of lectures and the way he immediately captured my attention held it injected humor and made me like him was fantastic intro to human behavior indeed,positive
i really hope that professor sapolsky knows how many people all over the world he captures through the screen with his amazing ability to teach ,positive
the fact that we can access this lecture without having to attend stanford is mindblowing what a time to be alive,positive
im literally in middle school yet im able to follow this to an extent really makes it obvious that this professors great at his job,positive
im so grateful for living in an era where this kind of content is available like this im from brazil and i wouldnt be able to listen to this amazing classes if stanford and professor sapolsky werent so kind to make it available online thank you,positive
coming back on that lecture youre an absolute gem robert sapolsky ive discovered this video a year ago searched my way through the infite possibilities of life finally started my bachelor in psychology and i head on becoming a researcher in evolutionary psychology or something like that if things go well and if i still like it hopefully i see you some day at stanford university,positive
this is an absolutely amazing lecture because he doesnt just dive into the subject he outlines the way to approach it without thinking in boxes its a refresher for scientific and critical thinking abilities designed to help unravel a very complex and challenging subject i think im going to be spending some quality hours here with the dr one of his lectures on koko the gorilla brought me to this playlist,positive
the fact that baby orcas have to learn their language shows how intelligent these beings are,positive
the fact that whalesdolphins can legally just be kept at places like seaworld is just insane given just the information in this video,negative
2150 its really fascinating to see the orcas movements in front of the mirror they move with this careful consideration and grace that you also see in species like the dolphin or gorilla or humans for that matters,positive
when i was a kid i was a given a plush orca that immediately became my best friend it wasnt until years later that i found out that orcas are actually fearsome beasts that sat at the top of the oceans food chain and honestly i just fell in love with them even more,positive
one of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesn’t mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca but orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt they might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since they’re known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so,positive
the lummi nation refer to the local orcas as qwe lhol mechen which means our relatives who live under the sea or the people under the waves orcas live in tightknit families in most cases both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives this is especially true for southern and northern residents orcas are incredibly intelligent and social their limbic system the part of the brain that processes emotion is incredibly developed and complex each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate theyre the only species besides humans pilot whales beluga whales and narwhals that go through menopause famous southern resident orcas fish eaters lolita granny ocean sun tahlequah who made worldwide headlines when she was spotted carrying her dead calf for 17 days moby doll shamu luna theres a documentary about luna called the whale famous northern resident orcas fish eaters namu corky tsitika eve sharky top notch springer the only orca to have been successfully reintegrated back into the wild famous transient orcas mammaleaters lonesome george fatfin chainsaw esperanza sidney and her children raksha and her five daughters,positive
i remember watching black fish and hearing one of the sailors sent to capture the first set of orca calves remark about how when getting the calves in the boats the vocalizations they heard made them realize they were taking a baby and that its family was crying because of it really unnerving information for a college student aiming to become a scientist,negative
orcas really are the humans of the sea theyre everywhere eat anything work in groups have dialects pass down skills over generations and have great teamwork skills if they were humans i would say they are in a sort of tribal stage its only a matter of time before they become advanced one way or another,positive
i love that seafaring mammals evolved out of the ocean were unimpressed with the land and just went back,positive
what a dream it would be to be able to actually communicate to orcas at some point communicating with other intelligent species is so huge,positive
howdy ho peeps we’ve a new track and a music video out with our friends nublu gameboy tetris they’re some of our favourite vocal gurus in the whole world we’ve been wanting to do something together for a while now and here it is also thanks to our amazing friends in the video crew for making the song come alive visually we had an awesome weekend driving around estonia partying with our friends we got to see nublu faceplanting from the top of a monster truck almost got joosep killed with a golf club ago set his guitar on fire gameboy grilled us food on some bricks etc enjoy coca cola  ps lyrics below,positive
nice songs,positive
it just gets even better the more you listen,positive
cartoon is so underrated but i am happy that only we a chosen few know about these gems,positive
this is a true brothership awesome video and song,positive
worth every minute i listened i am not either a scientist or a researcher i am just the average joanne who is so grateful that there are enquiring minds always striving to know more,positive
this lecture just flew by — always a good sign for me and kept me interested throughout — thanks love how seemingly unrelated eventsdiscoveries lead to more investigation experimentation and discovery reminds me of that great bbc series connections,positive
that alien analogy works well in every branch of sciencewhat a wonderful way to establish a context for such an engaging lecturethank you,positive
to visually see the smallest machines working in a living cell is a wonderment the smallest machines in the cell exhibit intelligence and decision making to actually see them in action in real time is astonishing,positive
very well done i liked your analogy with football soccer and the microscope to start as you went on i got more interested and i had to buy the book to learn more although i am not a scientist of cells i am a scientist of knowledge so your book will add to my knowledge base and maybe a breakthrough for me in certain aspects of my domain,positive
the start was excellent a good metaphor maybe its the way we understand the world around us and the way we learn any subject thanks for sharing,positive
this was absolutely fascinating one of the best lectures on youtube ever well presented very enthusiastic knowledgeable and informative i look forward to making my choices in the future i think the quote at the end was superb,positive
thank you for this lecture im still amazed about origin of those tools,positive
brilliant great presentation the future is going to be exciting and scary at the same time great technology seems to get weaponized asap in our world thank you,positive
bought two as a present for my wife theyre interesting little animals and a lot more intelligent than i would have thought they recognize my wife as the one who feeds them when she walks in the room they come to the front of the tank and start swimming up and down to get her attention if someone told me they do that never would have believed them,positive
im from mexico and it kills me to see that one of our national treasures is dying off also feel very much impotent at the fact that i cant do much about it c,negative
i have an axolotl currently and he’s been with me since 2000 or 2001 and he wasn’t a newborn when i received him believe it or not he is definitely a god in the amphibian world at least,positive
while really interesting i cant help but feel bad for all the axelotl that had to endure amputation and maybe worse for this to be researched especially the one that got their rejuvenation blocked,negative
i spent 20 minutes watching a bunch of cute salamanders while learning about them you earned a sub,positive
learning about scientists finding a new home literally made me choke up axolotls are my favorite animal and i try to support any conservation organization centered around them as much as i can they are such beautiful and magnificent creatures and im so happy they have been in the limelight more often these days i truly hope their wild population can begin flourishing again,positive
i cut off tip of my thumb and it regrew i was told it was because i retained nail bed which produces stem cells it was incredible process there was nothing to stitch shut no skin and couldnt reattach tip so they used a special material on it for a while removing that was horrifying but there isnt even any scar tissue and my finger print grew back too however the nerves didnt fair quite as well it has that asleep pins and needles feeling to it so i did physical therapy to get used to fine motor tasks and its pretty much normal now i wonder if animals new limbs have less sensitivity too though ,negative
my 10yo daughter loves axolotls i don’t know why i’m being particularly emotional from this video but it has really made me cry i’m going to look and see what digital adoptions there are for axolotls my daughter has a birthday coming up and a good gift would be a sponsorship in her name she’s just a bit too young to keep one herself maybe in high school if she’s still into it,positive
my teacher literally does this shows powerpoint stays on a slide for like 10 seconds says memorize this then moves on repeat like x10 everyday this is a lifesaver thank you,positive
all the dislikes are the students that had to take notes on this for biology,negative
pov ur teacher sent u hear then u got bored now ur reading comments,negative
really like how you guys explain the major points in a fun and entertaining way,positive
you have earned another subscriber this is both educational and funny you have a very unique way explaining things this is very useful for any science tests or quizzes i have ahead,positive
can you make videos about the structures of each macromolecule it would help me to better understand the differences in them thanks you are the best,positive
5 years old content and still helping to educate us students thanks,positive
the world needs more documentaries like this more bill nye as well,positive
povyou were drawing in science class while they played this video so now you’re struggling with the worksheet alone,negative
it’s kind of crazy how cells are so small,negative
great documentary,positive
good documentary,positive
what i find most interesting of all of this is how the underlying mechanisms for carnivory are rootedpun intendedin the genomes of many plants since theyre usually used for defense against pathogens and herbivorous insects with how common knowledge carnivorous plants are it really surprises me that they arent used as examples of how evolution works with what it has also makes one realise how plants are very much alive and aware of the world surrounding them,positive
loved this video i have always found carnivorous plants fascinating had had several venus flytraps but i didn´t know how they actually worked or evolved thank you for the video,positive
yes an “insane biology of” carnivorous plants i’m an amateur cps grower on my free time and a fan of the channel it’s the perfect combination though on 138 aren’t waterwheels’ aldrovanda traps also snap traps i believe bladderworts utricularia are the ones with suction traps,positive
woh i cant wait to learn about the biology of venus fly traps so i can genetically engineer my own carnivorous plants,positive
you’re awesome i find real engineering’s content interesting but it’s yours which inspires me to become a genetic engineer,positive
600 species of carnivorous plants wow and how did i never know that venus fly trap pitcher plants were both native to the us i had always assumed they were exotic tropical plants this was a fascinating informative video ,positive
thank you so much for answering this question i knew that it was a nitrogen poor environment that drove the evolution of carnivorous plants but the specifics of how their dna changed to do so was always a mystery and now i will go eat some bacon,positive
ants are truly insane did you know that wood ants even sacrifice their own lives to save their colony the territorial battles that break out between neighboring anthills each spring are warfare of the highest order involving thousands of casualties and chemical weapons our film team was thrilled when they watched two colonies how they conduct scouting expeditions and subdue their enemies,negative
arent they awesome true rulers of the earth ant love forever  ps hate to be that guy but the creatures at 038 are actually termites not your fault whoever catalogued that footage thought they were ants ive seen the exact stock footage used in tv shows and videos about ants,positive
dude where did this amazing channel come from absolutely flawless sound design script and editing,positive
its very impressive how much stock footage they were able to find on ants,positive
i love that even the indigenous people from australia who already deal with tons of weird animals were like nah this little guy is too weird to be normal,negative
platypuses are one of the coolest animals alive im surprised we havent hunted this thing to extinction yet,positive
the echidna just walking around is absolutely freaking adorable,positive
when a high youtuber explains biology better in 12 minutes than sober qualified teacher does in 12 weeks,positive
john green taught me books can make me even more depressed than i thought and hank green made me realize biology is cool which inevitably made me realize i want to be a forensic scientist thank you hank,positive
i just wanted to thank yall at crash course for this biology series last year i had to take a state biology test that is a part of a series of tests that are mandatory to pass to get your high school diploma i decided to watch these biology vids to help prep because i wasnt feeling prepared enough it ended up that a big section of the test was on a topic we didnt go over in class but i had watched crash course vids about it anyway i just recently found out that i did pass my test so just thank you guys so much i dont know if i wouldve made it through my test if it wasnt for these vids,positive
i love the way you teach i have adhd and can never pay attention so thanks for being weird and not boring like most professors with my adhd it affects me remembering things i want to actually know and learn this subject and other subjects and not just memorize for the test then forget everything a month later any advice on studying or other tips to really keep the info embedded in my mind,negative
my ap bio teacher took an entire week to teach us this and you a drunk man taught it to me in 12 minutes amazing,positive
i just catched up with the whole year of 9th grade and i have never understood chemistry this good thank you,positive
great way to get ahead so i can make it into honors bio crash course is absolutely fantastic its essentially free school and better school too its gets to the point and isnt all information its fun quick and educational youve done something amazing here hank,positive
youre awesome thank you for making biology more accessible,positive
pierre changed his whole production style too many people copying his beats,negative
pierre deserves every bit of success he gets he uplifting so many artists’ careers it’s time he gets recognized for how versatile he can be behind the mic congrats pierre,positive
this song was well produced everytime i hear it it puts me in one of the highest times of my life it has a permanent happy effect on me hotels money bitches good tree and tequila sunrises long nights,positive
pierre you truly changed my life with your sound ever since my junior year of hs when my brother played doublemint in the car i have been attached to your music since then i have had memories with every song that you dropped i just want to thank you for finally dropping this album and continue to do you and makerelease your music ,positive
i hate how underrated this man is but i lowkey like it at the same time,negative
i was alive when this man made music,positive
slaps like an abusive relationship,negative
this by far the best song on the album,positive
the insane biology series is so much cooler than the insane engineering series,positive
this is one of the best channels on youtube for sure what an indepth video on electric eels its fascinating what complex creatures they are i mean remotely controlling their prey is just next level stuff imagine what else is out there,positive
i absolutely adore this series of insane biology the long videos and high quality content keep it coming,positive
its shocking how your videos are so consistently amazing i would say this is the best series of videos i know of on youtube theres the whole rest of the channel however thats just as good,positive
genuine question during the experiment with the dead fish how did the eel knew the fish responded to its doublet when there was an agar barrier between them placed there to particularly impede the electric shock you mentioned the eels eyesight is poor and they rely heavily on their electrolocation of prey answers are appreciated thanks,negative
omg that little comment at the end about texas electric grid had me gagged lol i live in texas and experienced the utter failures of the february 2021 winter storm i love these videos so much and even just a passing mention of the electricity crisis here by anyone is something that makes me very happy to hear keep up the awesome videos they are very much loved and appreciated,positive
such depth and intricacies when it comes to the discussions kudos to this im learning and im loving it ,positive
really appreciate this series for both the entertainment and how scientifically backed everything is i had no idea they were the inspiration for voltaic cells and the remote control before an attack so cool,positive
i had the incredible luck of being roxys classmate in university and coworker through some crazy jobs she is one of the best artists i have ever met and a truly top notch person and friend 3 thank you for highlighting her amazing work isnt it cool as hell,positive
has there ever been any speculative evolution of the octopus i would very much like to see that since there have already been xenobiologists who have described the rise of octopus since they have massive amounts of neurons eg throughout the animal including each leg which has the ability to feel taste and smell it is known that they have a great degree of intelligence from using that different type of brain they already have their own video channels such as octolab etc but i remember someone showing drawings of octos swinging through trees id dearly love to see these creatures advance thru the eons,positive
an animal evolving a foamlike cover instead of fur is such an interesting and original concept goddamn now imagine if those foam glands slowly made the foam more firm over millions of years the glands adapt eventually the foam glands evolve into something similar to hair follicles that produce very soft bulbs of keratin we now have frog sheep made of cloud bubbles this sounds like such an adorable fairy tale but also oddly possible in real life,positive
i’m sorry but i laughed every time you said “greater moist boy” every time this was another great speculative world and i liked that it was an alternate history of our own planet the last few videos have taken us to some truly insane alien worlds which i have loved but it always feels nice to come back home and speculate about our own pale blue dot and all the ways it could have turned out differently i love your channel so much,positive
the speculative world ruled by decapods such as crabs lobsters hermit crabs and shrimp seems interesting considering how diverse they are,positive
one thing about the inhabitated lodge given its a desert animal i think it would make more sense if its tadpoles inhabit its back a protected reservoir seems tl be good for tadpoles in a water poor enviroment and given how beecomb frogs already carry their eggstadpoles in chambers of there belly this would feel like a nice nod to this real animal in addition this could be a way to get mammalian or placentalian amphibians of sorts if it would continue to evolve along this line,positive
i love these what if speculative documentaries i love the ideas of what if some animals were the dominant species friggin love the moist bois and the freeple my favorite idea is a cephalopod world in the game splatoon the lore is people died to a massive war and sea life took hold its kinda hinted their evolution was rapid due to either radiation science gone wrong or the lack of mammalian predators so i wonder what a squid or octo world would be like would both evolve simultaneously like the inklings and octolings did would civilization rise again i dunno i wonder what a realistic splatoon world would be where sealife specifically invertebrates evolved,positive
he literally explained a two hour long lesson in 15 minutes im shook,positive
let me just say god bless this brilliant man and his brother for teaching topics in 1015 minutes that teachers needed weeks for no offense teachers,positive
it has been eight years since this video was uploaded i watched it for the first time about four or five years ago when i was in high school i prepared for the biology exam by these videos i wathced this course when i was on the first year of medical university and now im watching it again im already finishing the third year and i teach biology scholars who like myself some time ago are about to enroll a med university this is awesome thank you hank and thanks to all of the crashcourse team for this truly the greatest course of biology ever made,positive
this really helps my teacher only lectures and she skips a lot because we are already supposed to know it and we are expected to know 10x the information she actually gives us,positive
i keep on getting med school ads on these bio videos and im like dude im just tryna pass grade 10 calm down,negative
my bio teacher is wellknown for not paying attention to any of her classes except chemistry and then at the end of the year giving out candy to all of her other classes and apologizing for being a shitty teacher of course that does nothing to raise my grade in her class but these videos do thanks so much yall for helping me understand this flipping course,negative
as a nutrition professor thank you for this such a great resource for students,positive
this song is essentially four different choruses its absolutely genius,positive
rip sarah this is potentially the best pop song of all time what a legacy,positive
i think this song is clever as hell the way its written and produced you can say what you like about xenomania but personally i think they deserve credit where credits due they make melodic pop music with a twist,positive
its such a shame this song wasnt a hit in america this is pop perfection,negative
the choreographer clearly gave them like two runthroughs of the dance before running out of time and just saying fuck it thisll do,negative
rip sarah you will be missed but this world is all the better for having had you in it x,positive
i cant see myself getting tired of their songs this song is one of their best,positive
in my humble opinion this is the best pop song of the noughties a threeminute masterpiece pop music is so dull at the moment oh for a group this much fun again as for those rather sad people who still think its ok to describe the bright interesting talented nicola roberts as ugly gingereasy to say it anonymously isnt it hmm oh and forgot to say downright gorgeous,positive
without doubt the best song that has ever existed a verse another verse a prechorus and a chorus brilliant,positive
this guy hes someone kids should look up to,positive
i feel like teachers like him could make anyone interested in anything big respect,positive
they could have this guy on 1000 times and i’ll still eagerly watch every episode,positive
as someone who graduated with a bio degree i truly wish he was a professor at my school his natural excitement and passion for science is infectious and i feel like he would’ve made microbio so fun ,positive
528 he chose the one most wholesome answer you could hope to receive mans basically said if i could bring back one species itd be the species that could save another that i love  the man is too wholesome my heart,positive
honestly just bring him in every week at this point id never get tired of him tbh,positive
this guys pretty wholesome good job on bringing him back,positive
im majoring in biology so mad respect for you dr thor hanson,positive
as a history major he speaks the way that made me fall in love with history he himself is fascinated by his own knowledge so it never becomes obvious or get boring,positive
i remembered having to learn about this when i was in high school biology so i came back to see if it would come back to me at age 37 nope i ended up rocking back and forth in the corner of my office in the feeble position then i snapped out of it i now embrace this truth plants turn water sunlight and co2 into food using magic,positive
watching this the day before my bio exam and realizing that i’m so gonna fail,negative
you are committed to having a better deeper understanding of our world or more probably youd like to do good on your test hahahaha this hank guy is the best,positive
i failed biology 3 times already this is my 4th time taking the class first time actually trying to seriously understand it i’ve been watching your videos that relate to what we’re learning in class i want to thank you for helping me earn a 92 on my first exam i’m so grateful for you,positive
the fact that humans need stab proof vest to survive one of these guys tells you how deadly they can be,negative
and there are still people that dare to say modern dinosaurs are boring just take a look at this absolute unit,negative
im from brazil and i heard ranchers telling stories such as about that time their grandpa saw a harpy lifting a newborn calf duting his youth or that day a harpy snatched a hound in goiás clearly exagerations wild tales but it shows the reverence respect and even fear the harpy commands on people also the state police here where im from has harpia as a callsign their helicopters,negative
i wonder if the harpy calls werent only used to identify primates without a response but to actually wear down their awareness overtime by conditioning them to expect calls before seeing the eagle we might see more of those mixups and mindgames if we observed them in areas where primates lived alongside eagles for more than a year,negative
ive been a fan of harpys for years now but this video blew my mind the amount of intelligence gathered by the eagles during the bci experiment is huge birds are truly in the same conversation as mammals in terms of ingenuity,positive
i cannot get over how gorgeous this bird is it’s just beautiful incredible animal,positive
you have the best science channel on the web hands down it easily rivals anything i’ve seen on television i am so damn impressed with every video i’ve seen from your team and you deserve many millions of subscribers thank you for a consistently incredible and enriching source of entertainment and education,positive
i train a small hawk and the strength hes capable of at his size is unreal i could only imagine what a harpy could do ,positive
the hour long complicated version with finger puppets is literally what i need,positive
ah the photosynthesis and cellular respiration unit of biology good luck to everyone else suffering,positive
i wish he was my bio teacher  he makes everything so fun and easy also who has an exam tomorrow,positive
probably shouldve paid attention in class questioning life choices,negative
adenosine triphosphate shoots off third phosphate group adenosine die phosphate,negative
ive been going to a 2 hour lecture everyday for a week and picked up nothing about cellular respiration crash course literally taught me and helped me understand this in 13 minutes,positive
my brain is not excepting this knowledge,negative
1730 do you know how you remember that mycology is the study of fungi because mike is a fun guy hyuck hyuck hyuck,positive
well i disagree with the answer to question 27 because mitochondria itself has its own dna,negative
i only missed five questions i’m proud of myself ,positive
i find too difficultbut i learned more from this video thank you,positive
2830 it was really easy despite the fact that my native language is belarussian,positive
currently i am in class 9 because my session is going to start from 1 april then i will be in class 10 still i got 2430 in this bio quiz  unbelievable ,positive
wow i got 2930 thank you for the video ,positive
2530 i did pretty good ,positive
it refreshed my knowledge thank you,positive
very interesting quizzes,positive
these speculative biologies are always fun to watch always makes you wonder what really is out there,positive
dumb idea a ca video thats literally just exploring life on earth describing the lifeforms with examples from fictional works in a role reversal way treating the very real animals like their pieces of speculative work and vice versa ie in the vast earth oceans live an apex predator unchanged for millions of years the shark though they look remarkably simular to the squidsharks of 4546b but are more closely related to earth fish than squids as a terrible example,negative
i really like these speculative alien lifeforms better than many weve seen on here i think its bc they feel aesthetically natural like they are unlike most earth organisms but feel like they still obey the constraints of biophysics,positive
my son used to love drawing his own speculative alien worlds from single cells to highly evolved he never ceased to amaze me with how rich and diverse he populated them i stumbled across awesome videos like this one and learned what he had done is a whole thing i share these with him and hope they spark his imagination as much as he does my own thank you for sharing these with us edit thank you for your patience if you still would like to see his old drawings its a busy time of year but well get the track down and posted on my little channel soon,positive
another wellmade video about speculative biology keep it up sir,positive
this is one of the most fleshed out speculative biologies ive seen in this channel so far the illustrations are high quality and the little interactions between these organisms in their alien ecosystem can be derived from the illustrations themselves and its really interesting,positive
something ive noticed about alien spec bio things is that i dont often see structures analogous to fur or feathers on the critters i wonder why,negative
i love that this had very distinct biomes and body plans from each other they all looked like they’d evolved together but really varied in color size and overall form it also allowed for much more realistic looking while still bloody great and weird scenes idk i really liked this one it was cool and kinda realistic in a weird way,positive
i would suggest checking out the anime made in the abyss for a potential episode the fictional creatures in the work are downright awe inspiring as they are bizarre,positive
thanks to cameraman live from million years ago for the documentary,positive
its amazing that the skulls remain in the soil for millions of years for us to do such detailed scientific researches on without them we never knew what they looked like or how they evolved fossils really are precious legacy of our ancestors,positive
its truly mindblowing to know how far weve come and how weve become the dominant species on earth in such a short amount of time considering how advanced weve become technologically it seems almost impossible to think that we are also animals evolution is truly amazing,positive
ill never forget visiting the natural history section of the smithsonian institute as a kid with my parents back in the 60s im 69 now btw they had an exhibit there that would blow your mind it consisted of a wall depicting human evolution where they had probably a hundred or so skulls in rows against a dark backdrop i assume so the images would stand out better it led the viewer visually from humans earliest known ancestors with authentic fossil skulls from the most primitive eg australopithicus all the way to modern man homo sapiens it was quite impressive and left the viewer with no doubt about human evolution there it was in terms of a tangible fossil record expertly organized right before the viewers eyes ,positive
wow i would love an hour long video with who ever made this that was so informative and to the point thank you,positive
some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative

me watching this masterpiece after 12 years ,positive
hats off to the camera man who traveled with the food  edit1 586 likes  tnq for the likes guys i never got this,positive
the gut is sooo important if you liked this video you may also be interested in knowing the indicators of a healthy gut they include colon transit time of 1224 hours type 4 stool on the bristol stool chart not having diarrhea or constipation having 13 bowel movements per day and lightdark brown colored stools,positive
what a great video to watch right before dinner,positive
respect to the cameraman who survived all that turning and shaking and the acids,positive
cameraman never disappoints us,positive
this is just amazing and very helpful thank you,positive
shout out to the cameraman for shrinking down and taking these sweet videos,positive
new generation is so lucky to have accesswith these kind of presentation,positive
content i was taught in two painfully long 80minute lectures condensed into 10 minutes of concise straightforward understandable content thank you for existing,positive
crash course is literally one of the greatest things to ever grace the internet,positive
just popping in to say crashcourse is helping me survive biology class ive learned more from one video than i have in the 1 12 month of class so far,positive
i love how excited he gets about mitochondria,positive
when youre watching this because your bio teacher cannot teach,negative
i love that crash course doesnt only teach biology but finds a way for me to care for biology,positive
my biology textbook is the worst thing ever written a full chapter takes only about a page and teaches nothing thank god for crash course,negative
if hippos were carnivores that lit their prey on fire so all the nightmares at once,negative
i like how the true dragons didnt end up looking like the stereotypical dragon instead they had a very quetzalcoatl appearance which makes it believable as cool as a dragon looking like draco from dragonheart would be i could see a pterosaurlike dragon being more realistic,positive
i remember a highschool biology project in which we had to create a basic phylogeny graph for dragons including drawings it was very fun,positive
i’m surprised there isn’t more dragons with names taken directly from mythical dragons i could absolutely see orochi gorynych lindwurms basilisks serrushes leviathan behemoth ziz python ladon and even to an extent typhon fitting in well to this family tree,positive
i’d love this as a video game create a skyrimesque world except where dragons aren’t mythical creatures but wild animals that could have adequate intelligence and small levels of society like a smart dolphin i think the approach would be cool bc it could be a mechanism for keeping humans in a medieval age since dragons would prey on cities like wolves on sheep,positive
since we did dragons and horse paleontology is so rarely touched on a unicorn or other myth creature could be another cool video,positive
a summary video two water  h2o uses a covalent bond each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen it is thus a polar molecule  all water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity – these are hydrogen bonds between the positive and negative poles of different molecules  hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion and thus high surface tension  cohesion is the attraction between two like things eg two water molecules  water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid  adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things eg water and glass  capillary action is water defying gravity  water is the greatest solvents due to its polarity  hydrophilic molecules are polar – their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water  hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are nonpolar  solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily when frozen  water has a very high heat capacity – it is good at holding on to heat thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets,positive
im an accounting student but i had a horrible chemistry teacher in high school and im taking this courses solely to have a better understanding of the world around me and all i wanted to say was that theyve been really helpful in making me understand with a little extra reasearch all the basics of chemistry thank you crashcourse,positive
this is what causes some bugs i think one lizard and also one jesus to be able to walk on water hank how the hell were you able to say that with a straight face ,negative
hey there hank im a junior in high school whos currently taking chemistry and i was wondering if you had any resources on heat capacity we were studying the heat capacity of water and metals like iron and aluminum which is somehow related to the video i guess thank you very much zelda,positive
i credit crash course with my success in bio105 when you cover 2 chapters a week and youre taking 15 credit hours4 classes total its pretty much hilariously impossible to actually grasp the material as you progress and really understand it,negative
im at a point where i watch your videos for fun you make learning so easy and fun thank you so much,positive
the best part about his style of teaching is the storyline and narrative visuals he doesn’t just point out and explain he makes you understand the whole biological process regardless how abstract the concept is he paints a picture that you will remember and that in itself is a true talent ,positive
im a dentist passed my boards years ago and am fully licensed but man i feel like a student all over again this is a phenomenal presentation and a great review i hope you consider becoming a university professor one day i like studying usmle material to make me a better overall provider in case you may wonder why a dentist would be on this video,positive
i need his enthusiasm for my studies his passion for medical science is contagious and so his happiness while explaining concepts how even the most complex of topics start appearing lucid such a kind soul i owe him so much,positive
hi i am a med school student and i hadnt been able to grasp the whole concept for my bioscience class until now just wanted to thank you for helping me prepare for my final exam which is coming soon,positive
believe memy teacher has taught me on this topic 6 hours ago i really looking for this video thank you from the core of my being zach thank to ninja nerd team,positive
1st year med student here and a big thank you for all the effort around embryology biochemistry and even in phisyology you are really making it easier and i am really thankful much love and respect your nerd from egypt,positive
this is the best lecture ever i had heard since my 18 years right nowthankyou man,positive
look i want to thank you to the infinity you have managed to make me love medicine with your fantastic explanations of things you are a wonderful lecturer keep going and remember that there are many people who appreciate what you are doing im a medical student by the way,positive
when someone explains something with so much passion 2800 it makes the argument so much more interesting and easier to understand,positive
this is literally an entire semester of a 400level evolutionary developmental biology course summed up in a 5 minute song fucking legendary,negative
biology aside someone has to mention how absolutely insane this acapella is musically he is not using any external instruments apart from his damn mouth absolutely incredible,negative
i still get shivvers from how good this is 3 years later,positive
this is a masterpiece and must be protected for future generations,positive
this song is fuckin legendary its been 4 years and i still cant get it to stop playing in my mind at totally random times i sometimes shout signal signal or hum random parts of the song while reading this song is like the genetic code itself tightly packed with the entire summary of evolutionary and developmental biology in a few minutes i was starting out with embryology when this song came out and this made me understand the genetic regulation part so well still waiting for some more amazing songs like this one this is still my favorite though it was my ringtone for a year,positive
this is such a great song i can’t imagine the amount of effort put into this video i remember watching this at school two years ago my science teacher would randomly play your videos in class sometimes this deserves so much more attention love the content on here keep going,positive
this is so incredible the fact that he can put all these talents into one the singing the acappella the scientific knowledge the brilliantly clever song writing literally amazing,positive
back before we blew up the cambrian like a bomb bomb shoutout to the precambrian explosion,negative
finally someone translated despacito to english im pretty sure the translation is very accurate,positive
seeing biological ideas combine so flawlessly in this video is so fascinating i dont know how to explain the feeling this video gave but the complexity and the connections are displayed in such a magnificent way far better than my textbook that i feel reinvigorated to learn biology once again with ferver,positive
why recreate adversity im definitely part of that subgroup against bonsai its crippling trees for just aesthetics and theres also some weird control issues to unpack around it just get some plants that are good for your local wildlife,negative
people like to talk about torturing trees like they dont cut their grass every week,negative
i like the part that bonsai tree can grow big if allowed and can still make fruitseed so we could theoretically save endangered giant trees by making bonsais of them and have a hope that one day there will be place where they can their offspring can grow big again,positive
so a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere but the question is is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger or is the tree happy when it’s small too the obvious answer is no the tree doesn’t care another answer would be “we have no way of knowing” people like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection people assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly this happens all the time so even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now what we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are i don’t think trees know this concept i think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants in fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it the trees definitely don’t need it either,negative
trees never ask for a lighter burden only for broader shoulders now thats an inspirational quote,positive
bonzai shows that life can be beautiful within the struggle im having rough times lately feels like giving up at times this quote really cheers me up,positive
dear hank thank you for teaching my ap bio class because you do one hell of a lot better job than my teacher,positive
i would just like to take a moment to thank hank and the rest of the crashcourse team for helping me pass my classes this semester i couldnt have done it without yall,positive
hank great video as always one question you seemed to make a point of mentioning more than once that protists are unicellular yet i was under the impression that protists being the grey area they are as you mentioned include all eukaryotes that are considered neither animalia plantae nor fungi i was also under the impression that some of these protista are indeed multicellular kevin,positive
thanks for making these interesting videos i have a question what about viruses do they also go into the same system or are they outside it,positive
reading bill bryson’a a short history of nearly everything had to pull out my microbiology with taxonomy textbook thank you for your detailed presentations they are helping immensely with understanding this tip of the iceberg,positive
thank you hank for acknowledging the constant change in our understanding of the world it amazes me that even just 5 years after this video went up the taxonomic system has changed so much that my college biology of organisms course has to teach an entirely new classification science has made a victory in the description of supergroups and the integration of the meltingpot that was kingdom protista into groups which better fit their traits and evolution just as you hinted might be a good idea,positive
hi i love crash course been using it since 3rd grade and now in 7th and still using it this is my first year in a middle school where we do midterms and crash course has helped me prepare for history physics biology and chemistry so thank you so much for the videos and plz make one for the 4 macromolecules of life and 6 characteristics of life thank you,positive
thank you so much for making these they have helped me so much with my bio class,positive
that was a great video i wish you were my teacher or my daughters teacher you make it fun and keep us interested throughout thank you hank,positive
he literally explained speedvelocity and distancedisplacement in 20 minutes i need him to be our physics teacher right now,positive
that moment when you learn more in youtube for free than your professors,positive
this will save someones semester early if they see it right now,positive
you have taught me more in 53 minutes than my physics teacher has taught me in a year thank you,positive
taking physics this upcoming fall semester have zero idea about what im getting myself into im shaky in math i figured id get a head start thank you,positive
this video is the very meaning of not all heroes wear capes because this mans is my hero and i appreciate the heck out of this youtube channel thank you so much for all your hard work,positive
i am literally 12 years old and i can understand his content better than all of my books textbooks teachers and schools this guy is truly a legend,positive
this person delivers lessons perfectly and smoothly like a programmed robot if teachers were very competent like him people would love science and consider it just like a cake eating,positive
hi guys we hope youre enjoying this doc we wanted to let you know that weve released a new video just in time to celebrate the 51st anniversary of the first moon landing if thats your cup of tea ,positive
i love how you explain everything with physical examples that makes it easier to understand keep the good work and please continue sharing the discoveries made about quantum mechanics,positive
this is truly going down a rabbit hole i cant imagine the number of experiments that would have to be conducted to make such discoveries and the amount of note taking and record this is brilliant you have to be different to be able to carry on trying new way of doing things,positive
amazing documentary things like this always blows my mind and enables me to think widely and at the end of a topic when i learn something new and astonishing i cant help but smile bcs these are so amusing also huge respect to the scientists who are able to think and invent and see the world is such different perspectives they inspire me a lot,positive
this is amazing i love the unique style of presentation thank you for simplifying the entire concept of quantum mechanics,positive
mindblowing confusing enchantingreally love your efforts to help us understand the utterly confusing quantum world,positive
brilliant documentary jim alkhalili is an incredible presenter it so impressive how he manages to communicate this immensely complicated stuff in a way that people actually can understand it,positive
the doc is absolutely brilliant and an eyeopener thank you for it and more please many thanks,positive
i have watched this video for the 3rd time and it still fascinates me how there are still so much to learn about our world this is the first ever video that has introduced me to watching the intriguing explanations of quantum mechanics that now it has become my hobby during past time unfortunately since i am on a different profession this will just be a hobby i really wish i could dig deep into the rabbits hole kudos to jim alkhalili and spark for keeping it simple and mind blowing,positive
i am so unbelievably happy ans i havent even watched part ii i mean i know how it ends maybe i graduated in it but this is how you should teach physics to students this is entertaining its simple but extremely detailed and understandable at all levels you wont get a class of teens looking at you like youre reciting the bible in latin backwards and then an average c score at the end this is what physics is fun endless thinking endless possibilities endless learning physics is the language of existence and we are just toddlers slowly navigating our ways through learning the abcs of it at any given point in time this is life teaching us theres nothing better than this nothing yeh,positive
im late to this party but i wanted to let you know that your explanation of relativity and the graphic of the two trains has helped more of my physics students than any thing else i have come across simple elegant and accessible thanks for the great videos,positive
i like how he explains the speed of light at the speed of light,positive
this is exceptionally explained i was also a student of physics and can somewhat understand the complexities involved i only wish that he should have taken half an hour instead of 15 minutes hats off to you sir and thanks,positive
really a video worth watching whenever i feel really negative about physics being attacked always by the odds in classrooms and exams this video heals me though i watch i cant understand all of themhope to understand in the near future,positive
your explanatory description for the general relativity theory is phenomenal it solved a long time confusion for me thank you,positive
i never truly understood the difference between weight and mass until i heard your explanation thank you,positive
time crystals have got to be one of the coolest scientific names given to an object,positive
i love how the scientist explained what 37 sigma represents in a coin toss its much more easy to understand and i think if he didnt i would certainly be confused its always great to translate these discoveries into something more people can reach,positive
its so awesome that they managed to find a way to legitimately call something a time crystal,positive
quanta first video i watch of yours and i gotta say im very impressed 1 you dumb down sophisticated subjects adequately like not condensending and not too high level props to your script writer this is not easy so gj 2 your community is respectful and curious and i thoroughly enjoy this corner of the internet im going to check out a couple more of your vids and if its the same story you earned yourself a sub thank you and keep it up,positive
this is beautiful this video implicitly tells you that how science works science doesn’t always comprise of eureka moments often scientists slog through different inconsistencies assumptions and opposing theories to purport a hypothesis,positive
its amazing to see how much we still have to learn,positive
thanks for creating this site although i am a retired physicist it is exciting to read about what discoveries are being made particularly in quantum world,positive
thank you so much quanta magazine to fill young hearts with this deep inquisitiveness and fascination with the reality around the true potential of the platform is limitless this epic summary just resonates so many unexplained questions than i had the time before,positive
people overlook physics too much this is where the cool stuff comes from,positive
you speak so fluidly like a natural cant wait to see what is in store for the future of your channel,positive
thank you i am writing a book and i needed some basic instruction on physics i look forward to more of your lessons,positive
in the first 20 seconds ive learned something important thank you you are a wise teacher i am grateful for the opportunity to learn,positive
no one chemist ill just throw acid on a gas vehicle,negative
this channel helped me get an a in physics 7your time is truly worth it for these videos,positive
i will be taking physics in my sophomore year next year and i really like this video now i can somewhat expect the things i would have to interpret next year,positive
thank you very much for a simple intro to a described complex subject i look forward to watching more of your videos so i can understand this unique language of physics,positive
as a programmer this was the most intuitively understandable episode in 7 years of pbs spacetime,positive
cant help but quote douglas adams there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable there is another theory which states that this has already happened”,negative
sending the electron through a magnetic field doesnt seem like asking are you spin up or down but rather will you orient yourself up or down when subjected to this field and it seems logical that the leftright alignment would be random after that since then youre asking will you orient yourself left of right when subjected to this orthogonal field anyway taking this sort of observer centric view probably often leads one to boltzmann brains and other rather useless hypersimplified things,negative
this episode was such a pay off for those of us who have been on this journey of discovery with space time from the beginning it feels like season finale of the 8th season of a show where it basically explains that everything you thought was important was actually meaningless and that the acceptance of this fact is actually the point,positive
a literal genius asking what is omg is exactly the situation i needed to see,positive
i used to see this guy on every space and universe documentary in the 2000s glad hes still going full swing,positive
he is so genius that even the omg was beyond for his learning,positive
i just cant get my head around about how insanely lucky we are to have such amazing people talking to us through the internet i know this video is a bit older so who cares but that was a thought that constantly went through my head while watching this,positive
this dude has the most stereotypical scientist hair and i love it,positive
hes such a great science communicator were lucky to have him,positive
theres no such thing as dumb question i hope a lot of people especially teachers understand this,positive
i love how he says theres a nobel prize waiting to find that answer like hes telling us to not fear math or physics and give it s try haha i love it ,positive
string theory could not be more simplified than this 0210 not all genius minds can teach well his students are lucky,positive
i’m eleven years old and wanting to get a start on physics early to get into a good college and this is precisely the thing i am looking for thank you so much,positive
this is so much better than it was in school,positive
i love the way you explain all of this thank you so much for sharing this and explaining so well for the motivational words you throw in while you explain i learn so much with your videos and wanted to express my gratitude  please don’t stop making videos,positive
you are amazing currently taking physics in my senior year of college and got a professor who is new at teaching soso confusing but you explain it so well ,positive
we live in a privileged age where we have the benefit of massive accumalated knowledge of the generations before us,positive
ive never felt like physics is so approachable until watching this video great content,positive
25 years old and well versed in physics this was engaging to me even though i already knew the info and that shows how well this man teaches future bookmark for home schooling my kids,positive
very motivating introduction to physics,positive
im a physics graduate and watching the experts discussions made me feel like sht the more you learn the more you realize how much you actually dont know,negative
the first kid in this video is way beyond most kids with his ability to understand abstract concepts the fact he was able to answer some of those questions was really impressive and not at all typical,positive
they cheated by hiring the smartest 8yearold they could find,negative
the kid explained physics very well for that man glad he shared his knowledge,positive
all of these people are very well educated for their respective maturity groups the 9 year old is very bright the teenager is wise beyond her years and the college student guy had some encouraging curiosity,positive
as an astronomy major and studying astrophysics this makes me more excited in the field im currently learning,positive
physicists are not quittersyouve saved my life,positive
i loved this it was very informative and a great overview could you perhaps do a map of engineering too,positive
fun fact my school has this poster in their physics class i saw it was from youtube and searched it,positive
i know theyre all science subjects and ive found them genuinely very very helpful so i was just wondering if youve ever thought about making a map for business or economics or well commerce students im in the middle of shifting from sci to commerce depending on my exam results that is but ive loved all of your maps thus far so id really appreciate it if you ever make a video on business management or banking or stocks or anything along those lines just a tiny suggestion,positive
this is the most interesting video i have ever watched about physics in general thank you,positive
i love physics i cant express it in words,positive
its one of the most interesting videos that ive ever seen in my life i wanted to get an idea a kind of overview of the laws of our physical reality being represented as a total picture which youve rightly named as the map of physics and youve shown it wonderfully in your video im very thankful grateful to you for enlightening us with the gift of knowledge in such an orderly interesting form in its totality and many thanks to you for adding philosophy to its end for addressing the unending quests of mankind for the unknown unknowable truths,positive
ive studied a bit of all sorts of physics quantum physics classical and relativistic physics regarding nuclear energy and radioactive decay but ive noticed that the classical physics of nyoton is still the hardest for me especially the motion of liquids and solid objects like projectiles,negative
watching neil keeps my mind open to possibilities,positive
this man can make anything fascinating and make me want to listen to him,positive
i got addicted scratching my head watching videos related to quantum mechanics,positive
this is amazing  i’m so excited for the future of these science discoveries,positive
professor kaku i’m so glad he was asked to explain this for us i am also excited that cnn is talking about this it’s what we should spend more time talking about fascinating things like this,positive
how wonderful to hear from a physicist about the new information about planets in our system and seeing planets in other galaxies my late father who was a farmer in the midwest would come into the house from the fields to watch nasa rocket deployments and returns oh how he would have loved this new exploration thank you,positive
he always sounds so excited about what hes talking about now that is passion,positive
i always love listening to prof kaku he always does such a great job at explaining difficult concepts in ways that can be understood by the interested layperson like me and his passion and enthusiasm are always contagious,positive
this was awesome more please,positive
up until now i was not impressed but now whoa  this picture is amazing,positive
it’s hard to believe it’s been five years since the president of the united states stared at an eclipse twice,negative
thats a great explanation thank you professor,positive
quantum physics for 7 year olds 37 year old me sounds good,positive
this talk was very healing for me i had some difficult experiences with science as a middle schooler i was placed in advanced english and science classes but i never really got science i was made fun of by my teacher from that experience i came to believe that me and science dont mix but now that im older i realize i do love science when its explained well and when it relates to something i care about i really do want to learn about quantum physics but have been intimidated about where to start your simple little explanations opened a door for me dominic i send you love and appreciation across the quantum waves,positive
this guy must know some really smart 7year olds,positive
four principles of technical communication 1 start at the right point from known to unknown show of hands err on the side of caution 2 dont go too far into the rabbit hole explain 3 things that pique interest rather than a whole load of information 3 clarity is better than accuracy iron out the finer details later 4 explain why it is cool enthusiasm is key most importantly convey it is not about whether you are good or bad at it it is all about being interested in it,positive
i wish my physics teacher was like him it doesn’t matter if you’re good at it all that matters is that you have interest,positive
hes so humble wish my teachers were like him,positive
how does this work hmm i dont know why dont you tell m number two,negative
the last one is very cool i got hold of 40 out of date teabags and brought them in to science club thank you for the awesome ideas,positive
on the first one it works because when your hand is closer to one side the friction slows it down on each side until when your fingers meet and the object is balanced this should work as long as each hand is moving at relatively the same speed the same force and there isnt any other significant variables,positive
teaching bleedingedge science to a general audience me without making it feel watered down is done nowhere else as well as here thanks to all involved,positive
years ago i was a physics major life didnt turn out the way i initially expected and now im in cs classes including theory of computation this video is very much the intersection of stuff ive studiedstudying and hits hard,negative
it would definitely revolutionize how science is taught in schools anyway whether it is the all in one thing that ties them together or not it could be incredibly useful as a learning tool,positive
this is the best explanation of counterfactuals and constructor theory ive seen i am sure a lot of good work went in to making it so simple to understand thank you,positive
i very often find myself not wondering what david deutsch is up to these days and i would be entirely happy to hear about constructor theory after it has accomplished some accomplishments or gathered some buyin within the discipline instead of as currently seems to be the case before,positive

people who take time out of their lives to make this much content over challenging subjects are the greatest types of people on the planet idk who runs this but i cannot express how thankful i am for them to get this type of assistance from a real person id be paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars to learn the same thing i actually watch these videos on spring break for the joy of simply learning thank you,positive
lets help this guy by not skipping on the ads and subscribe to his channel im preparing for my board exams in electro engineering and this helps me really alot thank you man,positive
i cant begin to describe how frustrated and hopelessly lost i felt trying to learn physics the first time around if it wasnt for your videos and help i dont think i could stay within my major your work is absolutely invaluable and your videos are actually life changing for me i cant afford tutors but these videos give me a real fighting chance to achieve all of my educational goals thank you so so so so much you are an absolute gem and i hope you know how much we all appreciate you 3,positive
my professor uses your videos to teach us during online class it has come to the point that we recognize you as our professor more thanks for your vids,positive
i just wanted to say that your physics playlist helped me immensely to get a 5 on the ap physics c mechanics exam your videos are a godsend and i extremely appreciate all the work you put into them ill definitely be revisiting this channel during college,positive
is it weird that its one of the goals of my life to meet this person just so much that he helped me a lot during a lot of hard times words arent enough to express how grateful i am and blessed are we to have someone like this amazing person teach his knowledge for free and continues to do so i salute you sir thank you for helping me out through times,positive
this kind of youtube channel deserves an award for the effort and time the creator has put in to help students great summary and review i salute you sir btw ill be taking soon may nmat exam for medicine goodluck to mee,positive
a mistake at 13353 it was meant to be 20m on the incline instead of 10m but overall i get the way it work and good explations thanks alot,positive
bless your soul man you are a time saver rather than doing a time consuming note reading i just listen to you and its already summarized,positive
einstein would be impressed,positive
real reasons our eletric bills are so high,negative
all i got out of this is our electric bills will never be free,negative
i was attacked by ceti years ago trying to prove that there were aliens,negative
can we all take a moment to appreciate this fly flying through the ring in slomo 526,positive
i have a pretty big physics problem that has perplexed me my whole life the closest supermarket from where i live is 500 meters roughly and it takes me 12 minutes to walk there and back at a walking speed of 5 kph 3 mph the problem is it has taken my father 18 years to make this trip and i want to know how this strange phenomenon has occurred,negative
when i was a kid i discovered that you could stand up a straw in a glass of soda pop and miraculously soda would come out of the top of the straw slowly like a tiny fountain back in those says the straws were all paper you have shown me the answer to this phenomena and i thank you,positive
the slowmo audio of the ring falling down the chain has to be one of the most satisfying sounds ive heard,positive
ive learned the flicking the bottlecan trick a while ago like 1015 years ago and only learned today why that works thanks a lot,positive
i think it would be cool to see how the results of the ice experiment varies when you use a fresh water ice cube in the fresh water glass and a salt water ice cube in the salt water glass you can also test using salt water cubes in both glasses and compare all the combinations very nice video,positive
i thoroughly enjoyed this science talk and learnt quite a lot then i would in class thank you now onto your next video as i down my nonequilibrium beverage ,positive
ohhhhh my god i wait for these episodes like most people wait for the next tom cruise movie thank god for brian greene for showing us the beauty of physics,positive
so great to see leonard susskind on air this is how physics should be presented no egos no showboating just great minds discussing complex concepts that us mere mortals can begin to understand,positive
seriously thank you i particularly am sad that i never pursuid physics in my higher education as these are the subjects that bring colour to my life i think it might not be praised enough that we still get to learn about these amazing ideas even more so from the most incredible field experts for free from anywhere in the world i would like to take these few minutes to show my gratitude towards these actions and to professor brian greene thank you all for your contributions looking for answers or more questions and communicating us the findings forever grateful,positive
i loved when you take a glance at mark listening to leonard speak because he just has the biggest smile on his face you can tell how much respect everyone has for each other and their individual interpretations this was a phenomenal listen and i can’t wait for more,positive
yet another marvelous production from the world science festival i wait for every new episode as if sitting at the edge of my seat as these brilliant hardworking individuals reveal more details about the saga we call “life” thank you so much brian greene for taking the time to help connect us with all of this valuable insight,positive
thank you brian and everyone behind the scenes who make wsf you are doing a great service,positive
please keep these amazing episodes coming brian greene is so good at bringing everything and everyone together to present these amazing theories to all compelling with stellar production more please,positive
brian is just incredible i loved physics growing up and wanted to be a quantum physicist but also loved medicine and became a doctor but my heart feels alive when i read any papers on quantum physics and attend such lectures may be one day i will become physicist for now i learn through such amazing videos and papers thanks so so much,positive
i love you and your books mr kaku im almost clueless when it comes to physics but your books are so well written that i could understand the concept to some extent i am easily hooked on reading every line in your books because they all are intriguing thank you and wish you everything ,positive
michio is such a gem for the world pushing our minds is always a good thing i dont understand most of his ideas but i try it he is so inspirational,positive
it only took one year of physics at uni to demonstrate to me that i would be better off studying biological sciences  the mind of a high level physicist is an awesome and occasionally strange thing to behold when it is on display i have great respect for any scientist who is also an educator,positive
thank you for finally explaining “string theory” in words a nonphysics person as myself could understand now maybe you could explain why it isn’t called vibration theory i believe with that i would have been more accepting of what you said today years ago,positive
i remember watching michio kakus shows on discovery science as a kid he made me interested in science and i probably learned english from those shows and if i traveled back in time to close the tv then its likely i wouldnt go back to being an engineer im a little sad to see him getting older 10 years later but im glad that he is as passionate about string theory as ever its funny how some people can change your life without them ever knowing,positive
i have a theory that i would like to get out if this is the leading theory we are to accept you inspired me when i was a young child michio kaku i read your book hyperspace when i was about 12 and it changed my life i have since been building upon many theories of many great minds such as yourself and i think i have discovered something that i feel i should go public with as soon as possible ive never written a book before it is intimidating and one day i hope to have your blessing because without you i may have never come to these ideas and even within my theory there is a place for string theory as it embodies such a theory in a way i hope to meet you one day thank you for everything,positive
as history goes all that was once a theoryhypothesisdream has been turning out to be possible in more than one occasion kudos to you professor kaku,positive
dr kaku nice to see you still educating us on the exciting elements of life in the universe you and i met in december of 1999 when i was a producer at fox news channel working on our y2k special the program focusing on what the future held for humankind was a big success and in my opinion you were the star,positive
want to get smarter faster subscribe for daily videos,positive
this dude makes it look easy respect,positive
he repeats his stories alot and tbh i think thats what made him such a good explainer he hones the same explanation until he masters it and finally blesses us young minds,positive
ive been following mr kaku for nearly 15 years now and he is still till this very day the best professor i have ever seen anywhere he influenced more young brains than people give him credit for people who will unlock the secrets of dark matter and so on will be people who were influenced by this man at some point in their life and thats amazing this man is perfect thank you sir professor michio kaku,positive
he makes everything seem so evident and easy im glad to be born in a period where this man exists ,positive
this was the most comprehensible and engaging physics lesson i’ve ever witnessed the realization that the big bang was the fissioning of universes…wow and i actually understood the description of worm holes incredible knowledge and presentation,positive
i have been a fan of dr kaku for decades his knack for breaking down complex subjects into easily understandable terms combined with a refreshing sense of humor makes dr kaku a natural teacher and a pleasure to listen to,positive
i would like to say thank you to all of the historical pioneers that have discovered the building blocks of bothscience and mathematics each of you are brilliant shining “stars”,positive
this guy never fails to make me feel like im learning something while also teaching absolutely nothing new and simply conceptualizing every sentence,positive
michio kaku maybe the most captivating educator i have ever listened to he is one of very few who make it a sheer joy to learn how to understand things,positive
should i upload daily also make sure to like the video and subscribe ,positive
he’s “rich” but can’t afford better quality lol ,negative
i love how he said his controller cost 10k but you can get it at games stop for 19 bucks ,positive
this acting is top quality and i started laughing when he says this game play is about to crazy,positive
i love how he sounds like a 5 year old when he says i got him,positive
hi everybody  i cant be online on saturday when this video goes live but ill check in later in the evening to reply to comments watch out for our second video today at 6pm,positive
neutrinos are what got me into physics when i was 18 years old and the more i learn about them the more fascinating they become,positive
neutrino oscillations might sound somewhat mysterious but really its just linear algebra complex numbers unitary matrices eigenvectors and so on she always makes me smile ,positive
a thing i found amazing is that something like 10 of the energy from a nuclear reactor is carried away by the neutrinos it radiates,positive
thank you sabine i love when you go into this level of detail or more,positive
ahhh problems with the standard model whod have guessed i had some wonderful arguments with particle physicists while living near cern a few years back but ive had problems with this particular theory since the copenhagen interpretation of the 1920s,negative
thank you sabine so we’ll thought out and executed my mind expands every time i hear you explain ,positive
i really enjoy many of sabines videos very informative its great to have critical thinkers for these complex issues she can be a great debunker as well she seems very objective and unafraid to step on anyones toes,positive
i feel terrible for bob  he sounds like he’s crying 1 like 1 prayer for bob,negative
this guy is 8 and talks very good im straight up crying for him,positive
she was my life she filled my soul she was part of my heart all this coming from a 8 year old im 11 years old and i dont even have a friend thats a girl,negative
its not about money its about true love,positive
ok i normally find it funny when someone asks what a gold digger is even when he’s 8 but this time i just didn’t laugh he sounds like a good kid man,positive
u r a gift from god this is the first video i watched on your channel and i want to let you know that i wish you a prosperous life filled with joy and happiness with fun times god bless you physicss,positive
i feel so bad for that kid he’s cute and i and i hope he keeps up the good work and lives a happy long life i hope you has a good life,positive
yo you helping this kid is the best thing on youtube,positive
this is the kind of content that has a real impact on the current revolution in the online education clear eloquent well animated a real gem for curious minds thank you for doing this,positive
when youtube search gives you exactly what you were looking for it’s new it’s long it’s well explained finally some good youtube,positive
as a physics student i have to say that this is an amazing introduction to the standard model this video deserves to be played at schools as part of their curriculum it explains all of the important aspects in a simple way that upcoming students can easily understand thank you for your contributions to science communication,positive
less than halfway through the video and its already one of the bestexplained quantum physics videos ive ever seen,positive
ive been rewatching this for a while now its actually pretty interesting but im finding it hard to understand the leptons especially the lepton numbers symmetries and the neutrinos but except all that i understood the rest you really explained very well and you made it very comprehensive and detailed thanks very much,positive
the best explanation i have ever seen about the standard model congratulations,positive
can you do a map of all simple groups in abstract algebra that would be awesome,positive
i wish i had seen this years ago trying to visualize particle physics in my head has always been my stumbling block and this video just made it a whole lot easier,positive
i cant believe how perfectly timed this is with my current physics class,positive
ive been doing thermodynamics in some way shape or form for three years now and this has been by far the best presentation for these concepts that ive come across thanks dr shini lecturers could literally spend two days explaining what she did in ten minutes in class you guys are awesome,positive
i love everything about this video i wish my expensive classes were as entertaining and as cleverly put together,positive
loving the series thank you for all your hard work,positive
this is so helpful weve been doing thermodynamics as uni but i tend to sit in letcures with my eyes glazed over because i didnt fully understand the basics when we first learned them so anything more complicated is too confusing,positive
this is honestly sooo helpful keep up the good work,positive
thank you for this video i am taking thermodynamics 2 right now and this is honestly a great review of all the basic thermo ideas,positive
thx for this i have exam next week this is lifesaving but exam is just little more complex but it whould start me up realy good love this channel,positive
physics is so interesting when you actually get to know and understand it i really want to sue all my school teachers for not doing their jobs correctly and for only scraping the surface when it comes to physics it really is just so frustrating when you are so interesting in something that you cant even understand properly,negative
very cool stuff at first i thought they need to explain these effects verbally then i saw the written notes you have pointed out some very good examples of how physics can be weird and provided links and explanations for effects very good job,positive
music that isnt obnoxious no numbers no annoying narrator actually pretty cool tricks not clickbait a my guys love it,positive
i love these experiments so usable and functional for people in quarantine at home love it ,positive
i really enjoyed this video i love how it teach everything in a so simple and easy way and best of all its short and eyecatching,positive
this is absolutely amazing thank you for explaining everything no numbers no annoying narrators and just actually being legit good people,positive
thumbs up for a great video of really cool physics demonstrations an extra thumbs up for excellent explanations in the description well done,positive
wow la verdad te felicito muy buenos trucos aprecio también el hecho que hayas puesto subtitulos ¡gracias,positive
amazing love these videos and cant wait until my kids are a bit older so i can show them the beautiful world of science,positive
after all the years i have been interested in physics i love finding out new things about how the discoveries were made and the people involved,positive
amazing lecture suzie and excellent way of taking a stand on the nature of science and how we have used it and how we should use it you could have even talked more about the scientistcivilians sacrificing or loosing their lives after doing experiences with new inventions etc many lives were lost due the lack of safety issues back in the days or just due to not knowing all the side effects etc excellent job suzie i am very amazed by your work and by your wisdom,positive
what a fantastic journey through the discovery of physics fascinating well done suzie for making a difficult subject to understand so accessible frankly i didnt think that this would be an easy watch but it was well explained and your excitement for science is quite infectious im looking forward to reading your book excelsior,positive
outstanding lecture interesting and fun thank you,positive
truly a remarkable presentation i read probably my most highly inspirational book by my newfound role model fundamentals the ten keys to reality by frank wilczek who he references experiments as well as other interesting findings in this presentation there’s also the book qed the strange theory of light and matter by richard p feynman which this video helps me visualize the xrays excitements these all ultimately lead me to a sense of motivation and question as to what’s left to discover well i position myself towards ligo virgo kagra into understanding gravity and gravitational waves of course education follows but for now i am currently reading a booklet called relativity the 100th anniversary as instructed i have not proceeded further until i am fully convinced on the requirement needed in chapter 8 for the vitality of humankind,positive
an excellent subject and lecture thank you,positive
really inspiring talk thank you so much,positive
very well presented and informative well done suzie and i will buy her book,positive
what a great way of explaining with a love for the subject thank you,positive
almost like theyre making their own fields and then creating particles by putting different levels of energy into those fields amazing,positive
i saw a video by veritasium where he showed the moiré lattice pattern he held two transparent sheets of a honeycombish pattern overlapping and i remember seeing the different shapes and structures emerging being completely fascinated i got way too excited about it and felt silly im a 30 year old woman and i wanted to have these sheets myself to explore these patterns theyre beautiful i knew there was something to it and this video makes me very very happy cant wait to see more from this research and channel im a new subscriber,positive
id love to see a more indepth video about the mechanics of how the stacked sheets create virtual atoms what are the limitations are there any conceivable functionalcommercial uses beyond research what an exciting development in physics research im surprised this is the first im hearing of this techniquetechnology,positive
so many developments like this seem hypey but this one dropping to 2d is such a beautiful simplification lends itself to sanetime computer simulation the moiré bit again beautiful reminds me a lot of xray crystallography maybe similar potential for discovering how stuff works,positive
this channel is so high quality and criminally underwatched another a video,positive
wow this feels like game changing research new technology here we come material sciences are fascinating,positive
whoa i love this type of minimalist approach to problems in general its so elegant here very inspiring,positive
humans are smart but i think we are really learning insight into our abilities when we try to understand what we perceive is the moon there when we dont look at it read about object permanence in psychology for instance there are many other interesting correlations like this which may shed some light on observation we are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious even our inherent bias may get in the way and like any puzzle such as a sadoku we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back and finally it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics,positive
absolutely fascinating thank you thank you,positive
i have for many years studied this phenomenon and i am still awestruck,positive
it tells us that we are looking at the universe through the wrong end of the telescope,negative
i thought the content and editing of this docu was really very good let down however once again by an agonising and overly intrusive soundtrack of bings bongs muzak and mood noise that was so distracting it was actually fighting the content for my attention please please dispense with this nonsense or offer a noise pollution free variant it is such a problem in shows such as this horizon in the uk is especially bad,negative
my mind just expanded with the universe straight up  ,positive
as if the designers of the universe overlooked the possibility that a species would evolve enough to work out some of it no wonder it makes no sense at a quantum level when they realise what were up to well know they know imagine that was actually true d,negative
subscribe and your life will be awesome forever offer only last 30 minutes ,positive
i remember watching physics and he is one of the nicest person i ever saw and one day i want to play with him on fortnite and i wish i meet himbin duo fill,positive
i would love the vbucks and the reason i think i deserve it is ive been subed since 400k and i love your videos,positive
man your like the best you make kids so happy when there sad,positive
love your videos and i hope that kid has the best life,positive
whats up been a long time subscriber love the content keep up the good content,positive
304 i can tell by the multiple times he says he’s getting high ground and how physics doesn’t care the he’s one of those obsessive jerks that keeps bullying even though no one really cares cleary the high ground doesn’t matter because every time he absolutely bodied him,negative
his videos are always funny and cool and kind,positive
i deserve the vbucks because i’ve watched your channel for a 2 years and i would love to gift several of your subscribers skins,positive
life man what is it even,negative
meanwhile this evening i did a bad impression of prof cox on stage to a few hundred people and even though it was so dodgy everyone knew who it was as he’s such a legend nice to hear him talk about sagan as many see him as a modern version,positive
we are a way for the universe to know itself carl sagan of course the scientist with the heart of a poet excellent discussion with a favorite physicist professor brian cox i could listen to him all day thank you be smart and pbs for the thoughtprovoking video subscribed,positive
you sir are a superlative teacher and so is professor cox this has been one of the most fascinating interviews and youtube presentations that i have seen but then i’m an old man an old medical doctor of a man who has had the pleasure of experiencing many good and great teachers in his lifetime and learning new things for me remains one of my greatest pleasures and this border conjunction between the life sciences and the physical sciences is one of my greatest fascinations i am so very glad that i found your channel and subscribed to it,positive
brian cox as always doesn’t disappoint… he’s very deep and thoughtful in a very accessible way…,positive
i absolutely love professor brian cox after watching his tedtalk about a year ago i watched as many videos of him as i could and he has incredibly increased my interest in physics and astronomy thank you for the great video,positive
this channel is a key example of why publicly funded media is still so important in the digital era the right people given the right resources can do amazing things and grow to provide so much more value to society than what was invested keep up the amazing work,positive
very thought provoking video ive always found brian coxs viewpoints very interesting he sees the same things as other scientists but he helps us think about it just a little differently than many which can help us think differently ourselves fascinating,positive
one of the most interesting informative and thoughtprovoking discussions i have ever seen thanks guys,positive
something funny i just noticed aside from looking sort of alike both brian cox and shigeru miyamoto seem to almost be incapable of speaking without smiling being experts in completely different fields both just seem so curious and enjoying what they do what a joy to listen to these guys and just have them around,positive
welp there are literally no excuses at this point you can literally teach yourself anything,positive
its truly a great time to be alive to be able to have resources like this be so freely available for anyone to use,positive
this is remarkably clearly communicated almost unique every single wording every sentence is chosen with a purpose the examples are very descriptive needless to say the topic is a bit complex it is adressed subject to an almost perfect understanding of exactly when the apprentice finds some topic extra difficult imagine having a teacher like this when being in formative years sometimes in life you happen to encounter people with an abovehuman talent to communicate complex matters in an accessible way simple enough but not to simple it is important to recognize this and to cherish those rare moments,positive
what a great professor thanks for giving us the opportunity to learn from you,positive
wow many a thanks never thought will be able to see course of such quality in youtube,positive
this is the first lecture where i actually ended up feeling like i finally got general relativity thank you,positive
thanks for the video ive always been interested in physics but chose to go into chemistry for undergrad its awesome to have great explanations and videos so easily accessible,positive
dear professor thank you for your generosity i’m actually listening to your lecture at work as music it brings me back to my university days lots of things you teach much better too,positive
masterpiece thanks a lot sirits a complete video course in its own,positive
when your physics teacher doesnt teach you physics so you rely on the internet,negative
she makes 10000 times more sense than my professor who didnt explain anything and just started writing equations on the board,positive
she has a lot of potential to become a rapper,positive
these videos are saving physics students lives every single day,positive
does the sound dim at random points for anyone else its like someone muffled the mic arbitrarily,negative
this is a better explanation than ive heard in any college physicsengineering course thanks,positive
electronic engineer here…you just explained static electricity better than all my teachers in university the topic can be very confusing for beginners this course gets better every time,positive
this would be a great introduction for a crash course electronics series i really think you guys do a great job explaining complicated things simply,positive
kudos to this man for going out of his way to present something that his students will remember for the rest of their lives,positive
i had a physics teacher similar to this my junior year he always presented everything we were learning in a tangible way with real application looking back it was my favorite course,positive
i remember watching this exactly 10 years ago and being amazed by it i tried the experiment in an empty classroom 10 years later physics still fascinates me,positive
i can learn more from this dude than my actually physics teacher ,positive
i miss his lectures so much they were posted here on youtube for a while i’m not sure if they are anymore but he is one of the reasons i love physics,positive
even knowing the results my heart was still beating fast when he released the ball,positive
we want more than this honorable teacher the theory and the practice in the mean time learning for the students will be a real pleasure thank you sir,positive
i never took a interest in physics but this dude made me understand the basics of converting gravitational potential to kinetic enegry huge respect,positive
for once a teacher got my undivided attention on a subject that bored me in high school and college i would have loved to have you as my science teacher you kept my interest thank you very much,positive
very cool my grandfather who died at 95 right before the pandemic used to collect physics toys and loved to demonstrate and explain how they work because of him i have a good understanding of buoyancy surface tension states of matter electrical conductance and many other concepts we need people like you to teach this stuff to the next generation keep up the good work,positive
those vortex marbles are pieces of art ,positive
i had multiple oil drop timers as a kid love those things,positive
i had several oil drop timer as a kid and i didnt remember for 25 years until this video very cool they were so fascinating and i could watch them for hours,positive
the perpetual motion simulator is similar to the space wheel that used to sell for about ten dollars used ones on amazon are now going for ten times thatbut theyre still cool,positive
this perpetual motion simulator looks quite cool i also remember having one of these oil drop timers many many years ago,positive
another knowledge to shared thanks a lot ,positive
i learnt about this in my physics book on perpetual motion a long time back very fascinating to watch,positive
the perpetual motion simulator is really something i could watch all day,positive
neon honestly looked like he was having fun with physics,positive
honestly he is a good guy when he ain’t in a mood,positive
235 i dont think ronnie wants to buy the whole restaurant,negative
can i just say that n3on is a savage rn,negative
imagine this guy with his personality if he is not rich,negative
damn man im seeing physics face he changed damn i havent watch you in 1 year,negative
n3on no way bro x2 me makes swish and breaks my brothers ankles n3on cant even dribble,negative
hes literally tripped out the whole video when you met him,negative
i think its really a testament to your explanation skills that the schrodinger equation seems like its the obvious solution once youve seen it it was of course not obvious even to schrodinger himself the time and effort you must put into these videos is astounding and i thoroughly enjoy watching them great work,positive
in all of my university courses textbooks websites and videos ive indulged to learn intro qm this is easily the best overview with the clearest and most wellput explanations and motivations thank you,positive
i love how you start building up from the historical background something we don’t see often i hope you will upload more often,positive
it always amazed me that when i was in school everything about quantum mechanics was a synonym of something very difficult and counterintuitive thanks to the pop culture and popular science articlesvideos on youtube after studying in university it turned out to be much easier espesially considering that classcial mechanics is not that simple either if i saw this video 5 years ago i would have understood that fact earlier thank you for this clear and neat explonation,positive
outstanding work i somehow managed to understand all of it whilst understanding none of it at each stage coming from a nonphysics background and with only a limited understanding of calculus to be able to carry a viewer with my limited ability along is testament to your superb communication thank you,positive
having taken a physics degree many decades ago may i congratulate you on such an excellent presentation,positive
just the perfect amount of details the depth and breadth of these videos are fantastic thank you for putting all this effort into them,positive
i hope you know this video came at the perfect time for me ive been teaching myself quantum chemistry from a physical chemistry textbook recently and i was using your channel to understand blackbody radiation haha glad to see a new video from you man you always put in an insane amount of time into these,positive
i am doing my doctorate in engineering and studying theoretical physics is my all time favourite hobby i am going to derive all these myself now many thanks for creating this wonderful presentation,positive
beautifully explained what a great refresher of qm with valuable illustrations,positive
let me remind people who are scared splitting an atom makes it blow up smacking two particles together doesnt make explosions it makes fusions,negative
everything applied causes side effects,negative
lets hope the next generation has a chance,positive
this is hardly earthshaking but it is wonderfully promising,positive
ooops pushed again into another alternate dimension i wonder what this one will be like,negative
we need more people like penrose he is really thinking outside the box he doesnt put assumptions on all the things he learned like many smart people still do we need more people like him who is curious and ask the right questions he truly knows where the black spots are in our knowledge he points them out clearly we are watching a genious of our time 200 years from now he will be known because he was one of the few who understood how little we know and where we should look,positive
wow i am so glad i discovered dr penrose today i wanted to refrain from any comments but i have to say that the interviewer asked better questions than dr peterson and he seemed to understand what prof penrose was meaning whilst dr petersons brain seemed to shortcircuited a few times my view is that dr peterson came in with an upfront agenda not to learn but to convince kudos to prof penrose for schooling dr peterson okay i said enough,positive
sir roger will probably be with us for another decade he seems incredibly lucid and physically well my grandfather is 96 and still going strong and he looked very much like sir roger does here when he was 90,positive
despite being a brilliant mathematician nobel laureate physicist worldly acclaimed academic i love how willing sir roger is to say i dont know,positive
arent we all so fortunate to be able to listen in and watch a conversation like this,positive
damn this man is sharp for his age my granddad bless his soul only got to live to the age of 79 and in his last 3 years he deteriorated to such a degree that he couldnt function at all it was sad to witness sir penrose is 90 now almost 91 and he talks about stuff in a very clear way which most adults arent able to do amazing,negative
dr peterson there is another physicist turned philosopher who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness basing himself in his understanding of physics his name was david bohm he is now deceased but he wrote a book called wholeness and the implicate order in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation and which i found very enlightening i recommend it to you and while youre at it you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics called bohmian mechanics since you showed interest in quantum theory his interpretation gets rid of the inconsistencyincompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way and in a way which takes all of the apparent magic out of the theory i was fascinated to see that roger penrose uses godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness since i came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics so cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man,positive
the fact that n3on calls everyone poor but he always wears the default in fortnite,negative
i like how physics says coach he kinda sounds like a cowboy from the westits funny just how he says it,positive
if anyone wanted to see something cursed here it is faze n3on,negative
bruh neon freaks out when gets a good gun imagine how he acts when he gets vbucks,negative
the way how the rich kid kept closing his eyes and making extpresions will making threats just made me cringe ,negative
“rich kid” me he can’t even afford a coach to teach him how to build,negative
nobody is born cool except of course the organic chemistry tutor who explains every topic in every subject a thousand times better than any teacher could for free,positive
youre literally carrying me through my electrical engineering degree right now thank you,positive
the fact that this was posted today right when i needed some kinematics review for my mcat thank you so much this channel always pulls through,positive
this person is a legend over 6 years on yt and has made teachers feel like peasants cuz this guy is the man for math he has rlly taught me and made me pass countless tests i am sooo thankful thanks,positive
really missed the time when i was learning physics in foundation study im currently in first year mechanical engineering study i really like all your videos it really help me during my foundation study,positive
thank you for sharing your knowledge im learning a lot from this channel its so much helpful,positive
i love all your videos they are not only informative but also easy to understand,positive
first ap physics test next thursday this helped soooo much 3,positive
im a simple man i see a dude with 6 pens in his pocket i like and subscribe,positive
frank is a fantastic physicist one of my favourites all those pens are so he doesnt run out of ink while in deep deep thought working out those equations love it,positive
this guy loves science so much he gets so excited talking about it he sometimes forgets to breathe friggin awesomeness,positive
this was the first thing on my algorithm and i knew i didn’t even have to scroll anymore we love you lex these podcasts are amazing,positive
if you read his book a beautiful question finding natures deep design you cant help but love the man hes a genius,positive
just as i’m getting frustrated with my chemistry and math this semester this podcast pops up perfect timing lex it’s time to get my fight back,negative
as a side note let me say a word about asymptotic freedom this is why we love lex fridman,positive
honestly for what its worth the physics of everything seems to be pretty well optimized if you have a graphics card that is at least better than a 580 xfx,positive
try using the replay mod then it will render the physics with hopefully a higher framerate,positive
i love your content and how much effort you put into it,positive
i haven’t watched you for a while just to see how far you would go and you went better than i expected,positive
havent watched in a few months and youre above a million impressive growth man,positive
i really think this would ruin the minecraft experience completely if it was added in but for a mod its pretty cool,negative
i love your videos keep up the amazing work,positive
you deserve a peace prize for single handedly teaching every student on zoom university,positive
i never thought i could learn or understood physics problems but i must confess that youve changed that now i am working physics problems and i have also been able to applied your method to other problems and i am doing it we need people who can break complex information down and also explain things like you do thank you so much for doing what you right and god bless,positive
i feel like everythings gonna be ok when i watch your videos thanks,positive
you are a life saver i got stuck with a pretty bad teacher and literally wouldve failed my exam if it wasnt for you,negative
ive been spending two weeks listening to my professor but i havent learned a thing until i watched your 3hour video you have no idea how grateful i am to you,positive
you do the best explanations without skipping the steps thank you so much for your time and work,positive
guys please watch the ads fully this man deserves the ad revenue for how much he helps us all out,positive
have a physics exam tomorrow and this clears up the material so well i cannot begin to explain how much this channel has helped me with precalc calc i and physics while studying to get an accounting degree,positive
you have helped me with most of high school calc physics and chem thank you so much and another thing thats nice about these videos is that people will always need them this was posted 4 years ago but there are still people who need this kind of help so thank you,positive
all of these are awesome i think i want to master the discipline of physics it is one of the greatest phenomena in nature,positive
great video thank you on my channel are a series of ion propelled aircrafts that are patented specifically for lifting their power supplies against earths gravity they can fly with no moving mechanical parts they create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards they dont defy physics though rather they rely on wellknown physics it used to be that ion propulsion could not lift its power supply from the ground there are more than 40 public videos of the craft,positive
amazing video thank you yes atomic motion is perpetual mass changing its position in space motion perpetual well for most of us billions of years is long enough so examples of perpetual motions does not factor in wear and tear of the device solar panels water mills wind mills geo thermal iceland john bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts i personally recharged hundreds of batteries with carefully measured results the physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view one device and what it does by itself yes thats being confined to thermodynamics however look outside the box for energy source solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels but from the sun thermodynamics is true in closed or isolated systems nitinol is also overunity which perpetual motion is a part of using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically the most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma an electrically charged ionized gas well a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas and they will be energized until the end of time by stars are we introverted into a small device set in motion or are we scientifically logically looking at the big picture as long as we stay stuck in a boxedin frame of reference we dont progress every advances made was possible by women and men who dared looking at things holistically from all points of view cheers,positive
starlite is pretty incredible stuffit can even be used as heat sheild coating on spacecraft like the tiles on the americans space shuttle,positive
this video is amazing i was like wow wow wow thank you for posting ,positive
these clips are realy interesting thanks 4 letting us know about these new things,positive
awesome and educational videos respect ,positive
nobel prize should be given to such great personalities who spread knowledge for free,positive
hey i just wanted to let you know that i am taking physics rn at university and you teach me much more than my professors actually do the way you break things down is so helpful and easy to follow,positive
i thank you teaching me more in 30 mins that my teacher can in 30 days,positive
he did it again the man who saves academic careers thanks man really,positive
you are amazing thank you so so so much these videos are extremely helpful you know exactly how to break everything down and make it simple then build on it thank you thank you thank you,positive
you are the best professor i have this semester,positive
your videos will teach learners the day before their test for years to come thank you,positive
love susskind and his no nonsense outlook on the world ,positive
quantum entaglement is a phenomenon that must be researched much more it is simply amazing,positive
on the stanford channel i obsessively watched all of susskinds lectures,positive
the audio is pulled from a talk given by susskind at uc berkeley search for it on youtube and you’ll find it not sure why this channel doesn’t cite that talk in the description they’re just repackaging sound bites with impressive graphics,negative
you know when someone is worth little if people talk about what he researches not what he accomplished or what his research accomplished everyone is constantly researching life just by living it but we dont give a shit unless you manage something useful and so is with this guy just very unremarkable,negative
i love how all the old theories that haven’t quite been proved to a few have been jumbled together into new science we are as a species so intelligent through trial error and years and years of mechanics and maths has brought us so close to answering so many deep questions about the universe when we as a species unlock all its secrets we will be the most dominant force in the universe,positive
this video was so good i didn’t even realize it was 8 years old,positive
i think weve just found the most intense hype man for trees,positive
its really amazing to think that this video is almost 10 years old i didnt even notice until after watching it compared to most other youtubers in 2012 this is god tier quality,positive
the second amazing thing is how do the roots pump moisture out of what can be half dry soil what human pump could duplicate that,positive
youre a perfect person man just keep going,positive
i like how he asked who she was then start saying he has seen her tik tok an insta,positive
and i love how you help kids in need and it makes me feel good about myself one of your vids nearly made me cry,positive
you’re such a good person and you’ve done so much for these people,positive
one reason i like you so much is that your so positive and you should,positive
math isnt my favorite subject but this looks so interesting i think that i can get good at this kind of math if i study and practice alot i really want to learn this stuff,positive
for all highschoolers and university students having midlife crisis computer science is fun since you get to build stuff that doesnt yet exist or build something that you use and make it a lot better computer science is the study of computers involving complex algorithms and youll be looking for stuff on the internet and stackoverflow alot you dont have to memorize everything like a computer but you have to know how to make a computer memorize and process the information and perform the activities that you want it to cs undergrad,positive
the way you described discrete maths made me realize i dont even hate math i just have to study to get better,positive
your videos are so solid and legitimately helpful you have an understanding of the topics and give in depth contentexamples thanks my man nuggets of youtube,positive
wow i swear this is one of the best youtube channels ive ever come across youre exceptionally knowledgeable about all these fields thank you so much,positive
good video im in the least popular branch in cs cs theory research im glad you mentioned induction if one dives into program verification youll see that induction is essential to doing any kind of proof because induction corresponds to recursion in programming induction on the natural numbers may not be interesting but think about induction on your data types and proving properties about them in fact induction does not only apply to natural numbers but any inductively defined set,positive
damn this got me more excited for computer science the discrete maths seems very interesting and eager to learn about it,positive
great video i’m back in school taking classes for my masters of computer science my bachelors was in economics im trying to decide on if i should do a concentration in big data management or cybersecurity what do you think is the better choice income and job market differences between these two,positive
thank you very much ive just finished my first semester at cs and indeed we did all of those this is great for showing what will be in the first semester,positive
as someone who just graduated with a cs degree i can confidently say that you successfully condensed 4 years of my life into 13 minutes well done,positive
its mindblowing how youre able to explain so much in a single video while being completely accurate easy to understand and also funny i think youre one of the best content creators on youtube and this might be one of the best tech videos ive ever seen go fireship,positive
thanks legendary content really appreciate the work you put into it,positive
im wrapping up my second semester as a cse major and i was pleasantly surprised to see that ive already learned a huge chunk of these concepts i really love this field so far and i cant wait to learn more,positive
no one can deny that the most important cs concept in this video is 101st computer science concept you just simply cannot let grandma down,positive
that was astonishingly well written edited and generally put together thank you for the work you put in jeff that was a trip,positive
my entire cs degree just flashed in those 13 minutes amazing work,positive
im about 2 years into teaching myself programming alongside my full time job and this is one of the best videos ive ever seen its the background language and contexts we dont get from tutorials or experimentation thank you so much,positive
im a young student interested in computers and i really enjoy your videos every time thank you for making these awesome videos,positive
its fun how learning is more of a speedrun these days which acts as a very good starter motivating us to learn the remaining stuff by ourselves and now we have something of a map which we can follow instead of blindly jumping into stuff,positive
absolute pleasure working on this thanks again for the opportunity,positive
i just started a coding class and the teacher is assuming all of the class already has basic notions of programming a few of us dont including myself this is exactly what i needed thank you so much,positive
finally i did it it took me around 67 hours to complete it including making notes and it has been very useful and i am fully satisfied thanks steven and shawn,positive
ive been wanting to learn programming for awhile but had absolutely no idea of what it all entails this video really helped to give me that thanks so much im so excited to start my journey into computer software,positive
im in 7th grade and just wanted to learn how to code this video is a great introduction to coding for me keep up the good work,positive
studying a computer science degree atm and skimmed through this video can confirm this is really good and the fact this is free you guys are absolute legends good on ya,positive
thank you for this amazing content many online courses and bootcamps fail to go over the foundations and this is exactly what we needed,positive
im finishing my bachelors in cs next month and im watching this because you never want to forget the fundamentals you always come back to this stuff,positive
hey thanks for all the comments yes i agree that i should have added in computer security alongside hacking it is a huge and important field so i regret leaving it off and i should also have mentioned interpreters along with compilers as this is an important concept especially having coded a fair amount of python i have no excuses i added a couple of notes in the video description thanks for pointing these omissions out and thanks for all the words of encouragement as well i was trying something new with the graphic design on this one trying to match the look to the subject matter and i think it worked out well,positive
absolutely wonderful,positive
this color scheme is the most beautiful ever dark blue neon blue neon pink dark purple just beautiful,positive
i am a final year computer science engineering student and i would like to say you literally videoed my entire 4 year course work briefly in 10 minutes great work,positive
i started my computer engineering course this year at age 32 sometimes i feel so bad in the classes cause im too old and everyone else there is almost teenagers also at this age everyone expect me to have childrens and a job not to be in college but now watching this video this made me so pround and happy all of this is too beatifull and ill do whatever it takes science is my passion since i was a kid and this is all that really matter,positive
as a cs student this poured a bucket of passion into me update i will be a data science intern at nasa goddard space flight center summer 2022,positive
computer science has to be treated like all the other science based subjects such as physics chemistry or biology its a shame most schools dont take cs as a serious subject,negative
that moment when you feel like a badass because you knew a little something about every topic he mentioned d great video and great map thank you,positive
i remember watching this videos in 2017 i was 13 at the time now im 18 and studying computer science a mad special thank you dude it is really an interesting field to study in you made me find my passion thank you again hamad,positive
the first time i watched this video i wasnt able to comprehend almost anything was in my 1st semester in cs today im currently in my 2nd semester of my 2nd year theres a light in a tunnel what was once pitch black now is starting to have meaning cs has both joy and suffering a complete balance,positive
now i know that programming cant be learn in 8 minutes,negative
im currently in my second year and im taking both c and java great video btw ,positive
in your video description you might regard c as the fastest language but this isnt always the case both c and rust can achieve the same performance even with higherlevel language features zerocost abstractions compiler optimization is a large part of language performance,positive
just finished second year cs and glad to find that our curriculum is exactly what he talked about and with such a strong foundation in third year we learn about operating systems more dsa and anything else are at our choosing ml ai computer graphics general swe etc,positive
i like this guys videos i probably watched his journey to becoming a microsoft engineer 5 times,positive
this helped me feel more confident that im indeed learning stuff even though i still have a long road ahead it was good to realize half of the concepts already feel familiar if i may suggest a video idea you could do something similar to this but about frameworks libs deployers package managers compilers git docker and all that other tools and weirdly namedstuff that comes with learning a language because as a beginner all those names are really overwhelming  thanks for another great content youre really good explaining stuff,positive
540 another advantage of twos complement is that addition subtraction and multiplication on it are simpler you just do the same as with unsigned values one way to explain that is using modular arithmetic unless you use long arithmetic numbers are computed modulo 2 to the power of the number of bits in an integer and the numbers that the same bit string represents in unsigned types and in twos complement are equivalent,positive
what a well laid out video im starting a masters programme in cs at the end of the month after graduating as a bsc in physics and this video really helped in assuring myself that im not in over my head and am actually surprisingly familiar with the topics to come of course i dont mean to underestimate the amount of work to come but at least im more confident now,positive
i just started learning python recently and this video was incredibly helpful it actually blew my mind how expertly you described these concepts,positive
all i needed was the child level and was like okay got it thank you,positive
wow i love how he explains things and especially his auracalming and not judgmental imho pure of the intention to i want to help you to understand this honestly it has been a very long time i havent feel this feeling very soothing,positive
as a final year computer science student i still barely understand “np complete” but this explanation is super useful it’s like abstraction,positive
i love the expression of pride and admiration and excitement on the interviewers face when talking with the grad student hes soooo happy that someone upandcoming really gets it i dont get it completely but im glad there are people out there who love to learn and love when others learn too fantastic,positive
i wish all my teachers taught me things like how this guy taught the child simple and effective,positive
it amazes me how passionate the conversation got when the grad student got onive not heard a real and genuine math conversation in a whileappreciate yall,positive
and so it begins procrastinating on my actual studies to learn something different from crash course,negative
love the material love the host its clear to me that you really love this topic and youre articulate and passionate im so excited for this series thank you,positive
i would really love it if crash course would make a course about teaching us how to program where in each episode they teach us about the basics of one language,positive
i feel like ive just taken an awesome short course thats quite easy to follow and packed with interesting knowledge and totally free awesome cant wait to see the next one,positive
ahhh i am super excited to follow this series i have had my mind set on becoming a video game designer for a while and this series gives me the opportunity to learn the basics of computer science thank you d,positive
im so happy you guys are doing this im a software developer and i absolutely love the videos you guys do im really looking forward to the rest of this series,positive
oooo im so excited for this carrie anne is a fantastic presenter this first episode was pretty dense already but it didnt feel like it great job to the whole team,positive
this is amazingly educational most of these are not mentioned in school,positive
become smarter for free at the first 200 of you get 20 off the annual premium subscription approved by skynet,positive
my code works i have no idea why my code doesnt work i have no idea why,negative
had a rough day and hearing hello mortals made me geniuely happy thanks you majestic science robot,positive
as a professional software engineer lemme tell you that the whole bit about having to be good at finding the answer on google is 100 true,positive
agreed with patrick cs is more about theoretical knowledge whereas most of the people are going to deal with application level programming which requires more application level knowledge i think software engineering course suits the needs of most of the people in this regard,positive
computer science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them and while you can learn programmingdevelopment by watching a bunch of youtube videos if you lack the basic cs knowledge you will always struggle to make technical choices come up with a poorsuboptimal design while this is understandable that for some people the cs curriculum means a lot of depth which it certainly is it has big rewards on your software engineering job once you learn it well it is easy to supplement knowledge related to the latest trending technology but if you have knowledge gaps in your fundamentals youre gonna have a hard time overcoming those,positive
its odd that everyone knows college is nearly useless yet every business requires you to have it just to be considered for an interview,negative
thanks patrick i raised 3 great kids my youngest is majoring in cs where i’m not qualified to mentor him been letting you handle that for me since 2018 now my whole family loves your videos many thanks for sharing your wisdom on tech and general life advice wishing you all the best,positive
techlead this is a fantastic video very well done in my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science i found that there are classes in every major that use computers and computer programming extensively in math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis in physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card we programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data i think you are 100 correct when you state that the act of programming is very important for every discipline,positive
i was really under a lot of stress and pressure to pursue a masters degree and i was thinking of doing a computer science degree since i had a bachelors in it too but just like you said apart from 1 or 2 courses here the other courses are havoc the photographer example was spot on this video really helped me change my perspective thanks a lot i really feel like this video was tailor made for me thanks again subscribed ofc,positive
for me what got my career in coding started was my experience as a student programmer for a company near my university that hired me on basically as an intern they hired me because i worked for them on my senior capstone project fall semester so i worked for them as an intern during my last semester through that following summer and then i landed my first full time job in the fall i would have stayed with them had they been talking to me and expressed interest in actually treating me like an actual employee,positive
i agree with everything youre saying but how come you dont highlight the greatest gift of a computer science degree problem solving i struggled through school but now looking back im actually very glad i took these courses for one it taught me the limits of my knowledge and how much there is to learn taking these classes dont make you an expert in the field instead it teaches introduces you to the fundamentals in the broad field of computer science armed with this fundamental knowledge you can have a much clearer perspective of how the pieces come together and allows you to problem solve better sure it doesnt teach you the practical skills but problemsolving is an essential skill for any career especially in tech when you strip away all the fancy frameworks and the technologies that come and go at the core what you have is computer science which you can use to build these solutions,positive
i had so much fun filming this video i love the final product thank you wired,positive
the little girl blew her cover so early in her career,negative
i like listening to smart people talking about stuff they know alot about,positive
im acualy suprised how good an precise she explaind machine learning to the child respect,positive
this is not just a computer scientist she is an amazing communicator she mirrors the talking points of the learner and always positively commends their opinions all while constantly smiling and making the learner feel at ease what an amazing person,positive
hilary is exceptional at explaining and engaging with people at all different levels of expertise,positive
hilary mason is not only a computer scientist but one of the first famous data scientists a very wellknown word today but not so much a decade ago her research and knowledge sharing has helped to develop the field into becoming the vast and useful network it is today great video,positive
hope this vid was helpful more lifestyle vlogs coming very soon midterms and assignments are only going to pile up from here make sure you have tools like grammarly to help you succeed remember to sign up for a free account and get 20 off grammarly premium,positive
finally the first guy on yt thats not a straight a overachiever student at an elite t15 school i quit school after struggling and finding out i had adhd ive been wanting to learn programmingcs topics this video helped put things into perspective that i can still make it even if im not a top student at a top school thanks for the video,positive
this was the most relatable “my cs degree in x minutes” i’ve seen thank you,positive
thanks jed you made me realize that it’s not always about the grades there’s so much more to life,positive
i love how relatable your comment was “that your grades were average for cs” one of the reasons why i didn’t go the cs route was because i didn’t think i had good enough grades to get through it when i think back at it i should have done it anyways,positive
very transparent youtuber always great content i’m an accountant major and i love your videos,positive
i don’t know anything about software engineering but i still watched the whole video i’m always down to any content,positive
i just started and i am a freshman it makes me feel a lot better to know that someone else didnt have their resume ready i started html css and js on my own and am doing to websiteresume thing now so i can practice web development all through out college along with other stuff that i learn so i can put all of my projects on there kind of like a show case,positive
dear jed im a comsci student but i dont really watch you because youre into computer science but i watch you just because i really enjoy your daily vlogs and videos obviously its a plus when computer science is involved just like when you made that messaging app that looks like discord my point is that dont be too conscious of your viewers and just make videos and follow your heart,positive
love your content jedcal keep it up i appreciate your honesty in showing the grades you received including explaining the courses that stood out to you during your attendance at bu edit it for sure makes me more comfortable with my academic performance how im not the only average guy out there,positive
i know im two years late to see this but i hope you read it thanks for making this im probably going into computer science and i had no idea what my options were this helps out things into perspective and honestly makes me more confident about pursuing this degree because it seems like i have pretty good options,positive
man your channel is fire finally someone who knows what people is looking for,positive
these videos are awesome man if i may ask what dodid you study i myself am studying computer science right now and i can say that these videos are really helpful for someone who is in doubt about what they want to do keep up the good work d,positive
im thinking about getting into a computer career this is my first time hearing like different titles about working on computers thank you so much for sharing this video i just need to find the right title that will fit me with dealing with computers because i like working all computers,positive
awesome im transferring from a community college with an associates in science into the cit program at my local university ive never been that great at math and after watching your video i think system administration or networking would probably be the best for me,positive
i loved this videovery well done and refreshing compared to the other career overview videos ive seen for computer science i have a degree in biology and have already written down those genetics companies you mentioned so that i can see their job posts and if i have a potential future in bioinformatics by the time i get some cs classes under my belt honestly the cs industry as a whole seems like a playground so many interesting things security cryptography imagevideo rendering mobile app development new algorithms thank you again,positive
your channel is fing awesome bro ive been thinking about studying science or computer science so thats exactly what i needed keep it up d,positive
i love your videos man mechanical engineering sounded really apealing to me at first but after seeing the mech eng elec eng and cs videos im thinking electrical engineering with a focus on electronics or computers sounds more like me may also minor in cs but idk yet thanks for making these,positive
i totally agree on internships i am a graduating senior in computer engineering and i have done 4 internships internships really showed me what working was really like and helped me find where i want to work despite being in the depressed covid economy i already have a job offer lined up for when i graduate in december,positive
also don’t forget to code outside of class and work on projects that interest you,positive
i think that’s what i’m most afraid of – getting internships early i’m currently a freshman in college majoring in cs and i have little to no knowledge about coding so when i try to apply for internships i’m afraid that these jobs that an intern does will involve hacking amazon’s database or something wild,negative
dude looks like he works at a surf board shop in florida chills with his friends at the beach on the weekends while listening to glam metal and knows how to enjoy life better than anyone in this comment section,positive
right when i got into my first cs class in college i was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a 10 line program in c for two days and never did any other programming that first cs class made me hate cs because the material was way too quick i started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph and then it got too overwhelming since i was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week i didn’t have enough time so i stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because i was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses i understood how they worked but not at all their applications my advice read the textbook briefly and don’t read every word so that you won’t become overwhelmed and stop reading all together,negative
one of the biggest things people should take into consideration if they’re gonna pursue any it jobs or anything related to cs is that it never ends you’ll constantly be trying to keep up with the latest tech or wondering if you need to bring getting the newest comptia cert or if your current if good enough it’s a rough life especially if you’re married or in a relationship it’s just constantly hours in front of the screen,negative
the videos on this channel are so great its really a pity that you dont seem to be creating content anymore,positive
nice work the animations did a great job of illustrating your points and it was well presented and explained i really enjoyed it,positive
this is an awesome video i havent found anything else that gives such a good intro to the pnp problem,positive
i dont know a lot about computer science but your visuals and the way you formulate the argument are very good,positive
i dont have a computer but it seems very helpful so i hope soon to get one   i like how it teaches you about it so fascinating,positive
learning how to code helps your everyday logic tremendously youll learn how to think more efficiently,positive
if you want to motivate people for your subject your goal should not be to show them how simple it is but instead how deep it is,positive
ill definitely teach my kids about computer science thanks for the priceless knowledge ,positive
what a brilliant speaker i appreciate that he stood and didnt move the effect was i listened instead of being distracted by him moving and gesturing as a result of his presentation i intend to take his advice to learn more about computer science thank you hadi partovi for being a person who has changed the world with your passion and knowledge,positive
im also a computer science graduate from iran and im completely agree with the transformation of this field which is happening to the world,positive
what i love about computer programming in particular is that unlike any other subject taught in schools this one forces students to use the creative and logical parts of their brains for once what every country needs for success is smart people that can come up with solutions so i believe computer programming is something that should be taught from early on in order to train young minds of course its not for everyone i know people who wont understand it no matter how they explain it to them but then again mindless memorizing is not for everyone either,positive
last year i helped 4th and 5th grade students participate in hour of code this year our second graders got involved as did a class of special needs middle school students our students are begging to do more and i am going to give them as many opportunities as i can,positive
i agree another thing that would be nice is more integration of computers into the rest of the classes for example math classes could teach excel graphs and formulas,positive
as a computer science major who will soon be working in nyc as a software engineer i agree with many of the points in this video my firstyear salary will exceed 100k after only a bachelors degree although this is due to a combination of several internships done during college the cost of living in new york and sheer luck and blessings many of my peers are also finding roles with great compensation if any high schoolers college students or even people out of school are considering learning how to code i strongly urge you all to make the leap,positive
one of my classmates from college was a former software developer he managed to break into the field without a cs degree but the company he worked for had to downsize they decided to lay off all employees who didnt have a 4year degree its an anecdotal example but having a degree in cs or a related field is a good investment for increased job security within such a volatile field of work,positive
doing my cs degree right now not gonna lie it sure aint easy but its definitely something i love doing,positive
short answer yes graduated with one in december 2018 now i make 80k at my job as a full stack engineer the best strategy is the degree and an internship or paid work to get a job it was well worth it,positive
thanks man this reassured me that even if my entrepreneurial ventures go to shit my cs degree is a good safety net,positive
im a computer science major and a few months away for graduation your videos have helped me out great job keep it up,positive
we need these types of videos in veterinary and nursing degrees there are so many misconceptions about the two fields your help and expertise would be great,positive
its been 4 years since graduating with my computer engineering degree pay is amazing benefits are amazing flexibility is amazing the projects are usually interesting there are so many openings in computing there are so many business opportunities as well its absolutely insane i think companies are really really desperate for talent right now i got lucky ending up in silicon valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world at my university computer engineering was 85 computer science 15 electricalelectronics engineering its functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned i chose to take robotics electives in school but dont actually use those skills in my job im just a standard software developerengineer haha i have a friend who went the boot camp route and struggled a lot in the field being the first target during layoffs and having to learn a ton of stuff that boot camps just dont cover with some tutoring and some years of onthejob training he is doing ok now too id definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning artificial intelligence programming languages computer graphics game development distributed systems and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry youre interested in,positive
man loving these breakthrough videos its feels fulfilling to see the progress being made i mean finally modelling quantum gravity jeez,positive
glad to have been a contributing member to this field had my first peer reviewed paper published in ieee this year,positive
slight correction the infinite limit of shallow neural networks as kernel machines specifically gaussian processes was established in 1994 radford neal this was updated for relu nonlinearities in 2009 cho saul in 2017 lee bahri showed this result could be extended to deep neural networks not sure this counts as 2021s biggest breakthrough though it is a cool result so happy to have it publicised ,positive
i appreaciate the efforts in trying to make these heavily technical subjects understandable to the general public thank you all,positive
its crazy that weve been able to do so much with deep neural networks and we are only now starting to figure out how they work,positive
mathematics is like that wind your sail boat needs to move way ahead on your journey this was so heart warming to watch there is really a thin line between maths and magic thanks a lot quanta magazine for this beautiful summary loved it,positive
i have been using these kernel vector spaces for qml recently and this is one of those mathemagics i honestly adore,positive
its crazy how much stuff from uni started flowing back watching this the fact that i can actually be able to understand all these complicated maths is crazy but exciting,positive
these videos are severely underrated thank you for the knowledge you share and hopefully millions of people will be watching these per week its so good for people to know about these things,positive
shane your video got me to major in computer science last year now i have a great internship thank you,positive
18 months ago i started a soc security operations center internship which turned into a fulltime job even before getting my cs degree in august 2021 in a week i start as an information security engineer making 90kyr in the mountain west region they needed somebody who had a computer science background and experience in cybersecurity so many good career paths from a bachelors in cs but the key in my experience to making the most of your degree is developing your soft skills and being hungry to learn more,positive
shane thank you for what you do it is very helpful could you do a video on benefits on minoring in computer science,positive
your videos are complete thank you for helping us young entrepreneurs who aspire to get out of this norma cycle and create our own skills habits and connections,positive
hello shane why dont u make a video about careers with good worklife balance thatd be wonderful,positive
you are one of the best youtubers ever man thank you so much for your information,positive
correction at 127 the graph says quinary system but then the graph shows 10 possible states which is actually decimal technically there should be only 5 possible values there but the overall concept is still the same note since we cant use annotations in our videos going forward if we find any smallish errors in our videos like this well leave clarifications in the episode description thanks all for the wonderful feedback brandon,positive
i am a third year majoring in computer engineering and this video explains transistors and logic gates better than a semester class,positive
it must be basic as hell for comp scientists or philosophers but this was fascinating,positive
bit at the end made me wonder if im merely a computer great episode john,positive
unlike most cs introductions crash course does a great job in giving the student context explaining how computers function at a fundamental level before applying layers of abstraction very well done as a sophomore computersci major im excited to see more enriching content every week,positive
just passing by to say that im loving her course and excellent diction,positive
just wanted to say i love the themed animations for this series the computer ui old mac os ui etc always great work to the animators and team,positive
a good video as always as a cs major myself this is actually finally a series where i can answer questions and stuff in the comment section just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info 1 there are also not versions of all the gates and or and xor become nand nor xnor respectively they are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate while they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts you often here people verbally nand and xnor when talking about logic so i think it is interesting to note even though this isnt computer engineering 2 while by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false this is often not the case when we actually look at real components because of power usage the opposite is often used generally the more common output is set to 0 3 0 doesnt actually mean nothing is flowing through for example we may set our 1 to 5 volts and our 0 to 23 volts this allows for us to have an off state at 0 volts we wouldnt want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off there are also other uses for this state but this may be covered in a future video,positive
oh my god thank you for clearly explaining how each logic gate is physically represented in an electrical circuit a lot of that abstraction makes it really daunting and hard for dummies like me to get it through our thick heads,negative
my first real exposure and application of logic gates was in minecraft with redstone,positive
advice to all beginner programmers computer science is not that hard it just takes time and effort,positive
we dont want over qualified students to intimidate others wow thats the best and honest thing i ever heard from a professor no wonder mit is a top institution the level of deliverance of education is way too perfect,positive
this dude is an absolute legend spitting wisdom and working the class like a bad crowd on an open mic night and the 872 thumbs down are from unemployed harvard students,positive
this is amazing who could have thought that one day i can just sit at my home in another continent and at the same time to attend an mit course fascinating thank you,positive
wow mit professors are much more engaging than my local state college,positive
i know i can never get in to mit so this is such a useful free resource for people like me who want to get into comp sci taught by masters thank you so much i plan on getting either a second bachelors in comp sci first one in music or masters if possible,positive
i learn more here than in my actual lectures at uni this is great also i love videos because you can pause and go back if you need to,positive
this is beautiful thank you mit ocw and thank you professors grimson and guttag for the clear and concise lectures,positive
these professors seem awesome my college professors make me feel like im in high school again with docked points for not showing up even if you have an a kind of hard to not miss a day when you work and have a family,positive
i just graduated with honors in computer science in september and i already landed a really cool software engineering job at a big and prestigious tech company so excited,positive
i like the positivity you bring into computer science im going into my second year and i am really enjoying the major so far great videos,positive
i’m currently in my senior year of hs and planning to major in cs i’ve been programming on and off for about 2 years and plan to be a software engineer your videos are great man ,positive
im a senior computer science student and i have been programming ever since i was 12 although i definitely agree that computer science is the best major ever maybe the best that ever existed but the problem i see that a lot of people are getting into computer science just for the money or just for the fact it is really popular right now and not for the fact that they are interested in computers and technology in general,positive
i love how people have interships in big companies like microsoft google etc and in my country there’s no companies like those i live in venezuela a very poor country i only want to have my degree and get out of this shithole,negative
7 diversity of options man you can work on so many things as a programmer super exciting fields like games or movies there are jobs in solar and basic betterment of mankind or like facebook and google for money,positive
i’m doing cs to be a software engineer currently in 2nd year of college,positive
im a computer engineering student going to 2nd year now so far we have tackled computer system servicing programmingc java and other minor and major engineering subjects i have no experience with programming but i was able to do just fine calculus was the only hard subject i took so far which is offered in every engineering courses we are going to tackle more about electronics robotics and computer architecture in the higher years so if youre feeling to take computer engineering go ahead its a good degree,positive
i was a computer science major but i switched to computer engineering last year there really isnt much programming after your first 3 semesters in cs after that its all theory which is great for the few that want to work in academia computer engineering actually allows me to apply my learned programming skills to projects whether inside or outside of class this is why i made the switch and have no regrets,positive
i’m an excs and mathstats student who actually just switched his double major to actuarial science and mathsstats the reason being was because i found out that cs is only about 30 programming the rest of it is theory of cs and various other theoretical mathrelated cs courses like advanced algorithms and theory of computation which i’m personally not interested in if you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms data structures and theory of cs as viable as it is this major may most probably not be for you if you love programming but don’t find the indepth cs stuff interesting i’d encourage you to instead selfteach programming or go through a coding bootcamp computer programming is only a tool in cs like math is a tool in physics,negative
both are s or a tier degrees honestly so anyone who picks either of them will be fine great salary and job growth thanks for the videos as always shane,positive
i just graduated high school and was stuck between choosing ce and cs thank you for the perfect timing you should compare these 2 with electrical engineering,positive
i actually dropped out of cs the first time around i had no idea what i was getting myself into lol i stomped it later in life though ,negative
hey shane love your videos can you make a video on the best specializations to go into for computer science,positive
i chose a computer science with software engineering degree and the doors of opportunity  have been opening ever since,positive
imposter syndrome is so real i think that ties back in a lot to your first question all of us out here have imposter syndrome because we dont realize everyone else is working so hard,negative
currently a bio major on a pre med track covid had me rethinking my career choices this past year and now looking at switching to computer science this was some really good insight thank you,positive
i appreciated this so much the problem im having is knowing where to focus i am a jack of all trades when it comes to most things i do and i feel so overwhelmed looking at job descriptions that require different skills all relating to computer science there have been a couple things that i really enjoyed but they didnt relate to coding as much which makes me question if this was right for me all i can do is continue practicing in areas that interest me and look for a job that asks for that,positive
oh my goodness i needed this video for years i graduated 14 years ago i have also struggled with imposter syndrome in recent years i finally started vocalizing that i didnt enjoy coding i felt like a rather intelligent person until i got into the deep coursework of my computer science degree i love how honest and open you are about this and its going to help so many students who are currently in the thick of this difficult degree,positive
im about to enroll in a cis program i wanted to know studying tips and useful tools to help me get better at coding and what i should expect to study i really appreciate your help im trying to be more confident and believe i can do this,positive
that was soo helpful thank you soo much and i never knew this syndrome was a thing but just you talking about it made me fear the major so much more knowing that ive gone through this so much during school and college feeling like the dumbest one in class ill take your advice and thanks for letting me know im not alone,positive
thank you so much for sharing your insights into comp sci im starting my degree this september and your video definitely helped me prepare for what to expect 3,positive
hi first of all great video i’m a freshman in my second semester of computer science and i’m kind of struggling i definitely feel the imposter syndrome and i want to practice more but i’m not sure where to look i’ve only learned a bit of java so far and i was going thru leet code and couldn’t really find anything for java do u have any recommendations,negative
this was so helpful thank you so much for sharing from your heart and being so encouraging  “you are meant to be what you want to be”,positive
i’m kinda undecided on my major i’ve thought about optometry but i don’t want to do 8 years of school my mom and dad are software engineers but it’s never really been my passion do you think a cs degree is worth it like especially with jobs and stuff after graduating are you able to still enjoy or have free time,negative
here’s a story for you beginners i went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding i got a c in intro to java okay yeah i did bad but then i wanted to get better so i did some practice over the winter to improve my logic okay b in the next highest class the following semester software 1 then over the summer i was able to learn so many other languages swift python javascript i had all this growth in a little under a year all i’m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn’t know how to code and don’t think it will get easier trust me it gets easier do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like it else’s while for loops etc to help you gain a feel of how they work i would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java as a beginner this is a daunting task for me so over winter break i made projects such as modeling a car in java okay what functions does a car have accelerate decelerate break etc from then i could think of variables okay what could toggle a car being on or off oh a boolean oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero okay that’s loop there with gas level modeled as an int see things like this slowly helped my logic grow and now i can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me trust me i’m still a beginner as well but i ended up catching up to the kids around me when i was once behind and in times when you feel like giving up please don’t i urge you to stick through it because it does get easier,positive
as someone who’s graduated and has been in the field for a couple of years this guy is giving some really good advice that i wish i would’ve had when i first started,positive
i would add two things work in group as often as possible have a hobby that you can enjoy without having to stare at a screen,positive
your classmate are not betterworse this really motivate me because i felt like everybody in my class have experience in coding and stuff and afraid to be left behind now i felt more confident thank you,positive
on the first point i had been coding since 7th grade and i had plenty of classmates who hadnt coded ever when i started college for those of you in the latter position we dont judge your for not knowing programming we are glad you are trying to learn and many of us want to help you i love inviting friends over to my dorm and helping them out with assignments and group studying you dont need to be scared of us or embarrassed that you arent a flawless coder we arent either and the skill we have we had to put in work for as well and we want to help you get to that point as well were all at school to learn and if i can help others i will i hope once i get to upper division classes that those friends will help me as well when they inevitably get to a point where they are better than me at certain things you cant be the best at everything also for the book thing as a math major double majoring i have a nagging need to buy every book for every class they are expensive but it fills me with pure joy to have a library of math and cs textbooks in my room i am willing to skip on a game or two for a textbook both provide me with entertainment because i am weird lol,positive
here is my story i’m currently thirteen years old and have been programming for a year i started off with the basics of c for a few months then i moved on to python i’m currently a python intermediate and now i started learning java i think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects i was fascinated by the cool games and projects i can create and that made programming even more enjoyable to me i would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club as suggested in this video because you can help each other out and build projects together i personally wasn’t able to find a coding partner of a coding club since not many kids my age know how to code,positive
hey man i just started my computer science journey at ucf about a month ago and i was wondering if you ever found a specific time during the day or night where you find yourself to be the most efficient with coding in other words do you have a time during the day where you just shut everything down and force yourself to just stop programming for the day or is it usually different for you every day i loved this video i really related to feeling pretty lost my first 2 weeks as i had no programming experience at all but am finally really starting to get the hang of things my professor for my intro to c class has been constantly repeating that 80 of the learning in this class will be outside of the classroom and i have found that to be some real truth,positive
000 intro 049 your classmates arent better or worse 151 focus solely on your coursework 307 coffee question 418 join a club 505 attend hackathons 606 learn computer science terminology 718 dont cram or procrastinate 851 dont buy a book unless you need it 928 outro i know you took my job but here i m,negative
good to have you back forrest ive been following you since i started chasing my degree i am now coming up on the completion of my associates in computer science and math from my community college and then transferring to a university to chase a bachelors i feel like i know barely anything about coding because all of my general education classes are so demanding did you feel this way i am really looking forward to only learning programming and computerfocused information because although i am finally in a java class chemistry 2 is kicking my ass and takes all my time thanks,positive
definitely wish this was made when i first started my degree the little bit and pieces of knowledge always manage to add up great video as always,positive
in a room with 27 people can everyone shake hands with 9 people no theres a pandemic,negative
i love how this is aimed at people who just finished high school far too many videos aim somewhere else say a postelementary level or a postcollege level,positive
high school students who want to go to stem majors in college should watch your videos you cover subjects indepth with practical examples this is what is lacking in the majority of careermajor prep videos on youtube the other channels would say you need to know math but are not really specific like you it would be interesting to know how many students saved time and money by not having to switch majors because they picked the wrong major in their freshman year thank you,positive
if you play the video at 5 speed he seriously sounds like a valley girl with an attitude,negative
this dude also created latex a software that is commonly used to write mathematics impressive individual,positive
no question about it this guy is a genius the idea of using a physicsbased notion of time like that of relativity and using that as a metaphor to guide his work in distributed systems and its notions of timing is a really powerful and original way of thinking,positive
im not clever enough to understand the problems this man solved but am glad he did,positive
i am proud that i stumbled on it this statement itself says how humble he is,positive
this man did more for mankind than thousands of others did yet he is still humble but also wholesome and full of soul love it,positive
lamports turing award in 2013 was probably one of the most overdue turing awards glad to see his foundational work and the whole field better recognised with such an interview,positive
i feel like the most important thing hes said there is coding is to programming what typing is to writing if you learn to program by learning to code you essentially only know how to type this this is something i always try to convey but never found the right words for it ill be using that analogy for sure d,positive
it’s certainly a honour to hear about this amazing groundbreaking work but i am even more astounded by his humbleness and honesty hats off to you sir,positive
one of the markers of true genius is thinking in an interdisciplinary fashion in my opinion this man has demonstrated only in this short time that he has knowledge of art mathematics and physics its no surprise he contributed to our world in the way he has,positive
wow 5 years have passed ashley gavin is a great comedian and an amazing podcast host crazy to see where people come from,positive
the less people going into computer science the more the people calling me a genius,negative
this ted talk encouraged me to go into computer science now im in my second year in college and i love it,positive
i think shes talking about software engineering education not computer science education math is an integral part of computer science because math is the language of science if you took math from computer science by definition you took science out of computer science which is quite bizarre,negative
wow this was amazing watching and would like my instructor to be like her she is to the point and understands that needing more programmers i am just getting started and it is all about problem solving,positive
computer science is a medium for problem solving and selfexpression ashely gavin i like her definition,positive
the first ted talk ive seen in years that was good even great there were some inaccuracies about cs but note that the vocabulary varies by region school and nation if definitions were your main takeaway then the video is not meant for you,positive
i did python tutorial after python tutorial and none of it ever stuck it wasnt until it really mattered at my job that i was pushed to learn basic computer science principles and not long after that python and i love every single part of it,positive
although she’s wrong about the math part i definitely believe that professors like to make learning cs harder than it should be,negative
update i switched my major to mathematics i guess cs was not for me xd,negative
it took me like 7 years to get my undergraduate i felt dumb all the time im glad pushed through im a data engineer and a lot of the stuff i found impossible before is easy now i graduated with a 25 gpa a lot of my teachers and the dean tried to convince me to change my major but i never gave up practice makes perfect,positive
the math shouldn’t scare you away i was terrible at math i just applied myself and made it not bad at all it just takes effort,positive
its 2019 theres no way youre bad at computers youve clearly never worked in tech support,negative
you lost me at mathheavy thank you for this information considering choosing another degree now,positive
im a first year cs student at a major german university and my current classes are introduction to programming computer architecture automata theory calculus and linear algebra i went into it not having a background in cs at all i really only went into it because i have a thing for logic and structure and i dont regret my decision at all at the beginning i was worried because i didnt know how to code at all and i had to put in some extra hours in the beginning compared to the kids who have been doing this since they were in infant but its totally possible,negative
cs requires a person who is patient persistent creative in solutions basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done thats how you can know further as you grow into cs you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem even if not from this field think research learn craft every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps you will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed and its ok because you also learn that progress is through error after error only for the new problem to come to you and apply the same process you already can handle being overwhelmed,positive
to add to this cs is also a major for those who like to practice outside the classroom i am a current cs major at lawrence technological university and the majority of my programming practice came from implementing the techniques taught in class to personal projects outside of the curriculum i believe this is an important element to the cs degree path in order to get really good,positive
i cant believe this is free online to watch and learn you guys are doing great things i deafinetly want to be a computer scientist now,positive
this series is a great addition to learning computer science ie learning syntax logic algorithms it gives context to everything besides its fascinating,positive
loving the series cc does anyone know any reference material where one can learn these algorithms,positive
ah yes the graph depthfirst vs breadthfirst search i also quite enjoyed the binary search tree bst really fascinating field of algorithms and data structures,positive
this video was incredibly well done this lady is really great at teaching material in a clear easytofollow manner,positive
ive always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we as humans seem to sort things it seems like were much more efficient than many of the algorithms at least the ones ive seen which is admittedly few for example when we look at all the items we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once eg oh i remember that was the smallest before i found the actual smallest so thats the second smallest let me put both of them first and second right now saving myself a relook i know computers are still faster in the end but i suspect thats because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data and possibly our brain has a slower clock speed rather than computational efficiency anyone know if thats true has anyone made a human sort algorithm so to speak that sorts the way we do including our little tricks im guessing no if not are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two like the one i just described,positive
in school i had to write a bubble sort in 16bit intel asm it worked was efficient and was well documented it got me an a even like 15 years later i am so damn proud of that piece of code d,positive
we got ourselves a 2in1 video with one of those parts talking about the 2in1 laptop lol i swear i just thought of that hope yall enjoy edit if you are considering the lg gram check out the new one with the 11th gen intel cpu and the new intel evo series to learn all about that check out my new video,positive
cant stress making more cs friends enough ,positive
as a college student this video was really great for me with everything happening due to covid19 it really slowly made me lose my desire to immerse in cs and i didnt fully realize it until i heard you say it thanks for all the advice you put out,positive
out of all the tech youtubers i know i really think forrest gives the most practical advice for getting in the industry thank you for that,positive
youre one of the best and most favorite computer science programming mentors of all time forrest i really cherish all your videos man youre godsend,positive
what you need to succeed in cs a laptop a calculator a good ide and the ability to think in abstract terms thats it,positive
i wish that i had a video like this when i was at university seven years too late unfortunately but even so this video is still useful for learning computer science and programming through online courses like at the moment,positive
hi forrest thanks for making all these videos about cs it’s really helpful for me i am about to take my cs degree next year i’m planning to get 23 internship during my 3 years of college degree do you think this is possible,positive
your content is a clear demonstration of how much passion and energy you put in making these videos thanks for such awesome content,positive
i was unable to take admission to an engineering college to pursue software engineering due to my financial conditions but i never lost hope i am studying on my own self and i feel privileged that i came to know about your channel thank you so much for such valuable content,positive
if everyone was like you study wouldnt not be tough thank you for this video and graph theory explanation what you made is not just knowledge but enlightment for me you do it like its a cake to you and i actually understand your explanation,positive
this is a great channel definitely will get much more recognitions in the future,positive
this is by far the best video regarding graph theory i have seen in my quite long life extremely clear extremely accurate and extremely useful as einstein newton here said 8 months ago this can be considered the 3blue1brown of computer science congratulations,positive
3blue1brown of computer science brilliant video,positive
there is a small mistake at 415 you would need to connect every point on a column with every other point on the same column same for the rows otherwise a graph coloring algorithm wouldnt work here since graph coloring algorithms only test for the constraint that each neightbor has a different color,negative
dude the way of explained this topic is so amazing and you made it look so easy to understand it is so hard to understand this topic from books for someone like me thanks alot for your help god bless,positive
beautifully explained and easily understandable to someone who knows little to nothing about graph theory or computer science keep up the good work,positive
this is going to be one of the most popular study channel in the future ,positive
this day in the life video felt really refreshing compared to most other day in the life videos seems like a great mix of both productive grinding and fun hangouts with friends keep it up d,positive
my boy is a fully fledged celebrity glad to watch another one of your videos,positive
hey nick the vibe amongst your friends and you is great love this video,positive
hey nick good video ive been a software dev for a while and i got to say your vlog just confirmed that university hasnt changed since i was there its really nice to see the perspective of a studentjunior dev helps keep me up to date on how you guys feellearnthink when i see you for an internship or your first job so dont give up on youtube man its way more useful than you might think good job while im at it feel free to reach out if you ever want a second opinion on some of your code it will be my pleasure,positive
dude all the walking back forth to get those shots of you walking haha props to you man,positive
nicholas t is the best youtuber ever every one of his videos brings a smile to my face,positive
watching this makes me miss my first 3 uni years  had so much fun,positive
the waterloo campus looks beautiful really makes me want to visit,positive
man i love how wholesome ur friends are,positive
your videos are insane the amount of effort that goes into compiling all this information making it digestible for the average viewer and also having it be interesting on top of that the insane amount of editing and graphic work to make it coherent and fun to watch youre going places man love it,positive
i’m currently studying compilers and language design i make programming languages basically and your explanation of highlevel languages to assembly was very good it was simple and easy to understand i’m definitely yoinking it,positive
as a cs major this is amazing work i particularly liked the part about graphics rendering the explanations are not only consistently clear they are concise which is a nontrivial feat,positive
i wish more people appreciate the insane amount of effort went into making this video the writing scripting animating editing voicing absolutely brilliant,positive
as a computer science student i love the fact that theres no clickbait you know your topic and explain it very clearly you earned yourself a new subscriber,positive
even knowing most of this information the way you simplify it and make it so clear is really impressive this is super well made and entertaining ,positive
its insane that you have 3 videos and are doing this well that just proves that your content is amazing keep it up,positive
ive been stuck in tutorial hell for so long at the moment i can code any mockup in html and css and javascript is a challenge i deleted every tutorial on my pc and decided to take this course week 0 blew my mind the problem solving approach is what i love it teaches you to problem solve and build things on your own,positive
strongly agree when i started my journey as a programmer cs50 was my first course and i learned everything online from net ninja tutorials w3schools clever programmers and so on now i am a mobile and web app developer yeah i can say it is possible to learn computer science without a degree and im self taught software engineer too buddy,positive
great video as a beginner programmer i agree with most things you say one unspoken rule of programming is to google everything you dont understand its simply the only way one learns,positive
i totally agree with him before joining this course i couldnt even attend a 50 min class in my uni with my full conscious but i attended their first class of approx 5 hours with full interest so if you want to learn python or web or ai or cs basics which he mentioned in the video do give them a try its worth it,positive
yes this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding for anyone thats getting deeper into learning web dev stuff i highly recommend scrimba it has a great problemsolving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what youve learned together instead of just showing you the solution first theres also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloudbased coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so its very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor you can pause it at any time and directly edit the code thats being written during the tutorial,positive
first of all congratulations youve earned around 40 subs in the last 2 hours from 129k to 133k second of all i love your content and the fact that youve encouraged me and many others to take this course is amazing ive been doing frontend for 4 months now and sometimes i struggle with some programing concepts in javascript soim enrolling now,positive
ive been taking the course and im still on lecture 1 good to hear positive reviews reinforcing my experience so far ill come back and update this when i finish,positive
i started it a few years ago and went to week 2 but started working solo and never came back to it i never stopped thinking about it as the lectures are really great and their approach is very refreshing i will definitely take it again back to week 0,positive
i tried attempting cs50 when i was 14 man it was a roller coaster some lessons were extremely easy to understand but some were hard for the small mind of a 14 year old fast forward 3 years i’m attempting it again and am currently on my 7th week,positive
13 years old long story short took a programming elective and now im here my father told me that once i learn to programspecifically python and learn some sense of web design and development he’ll hire me hes an it director right below the owner of the company,positive
dr chuck is a legend,positive
i did my undergrad in computer science and im finishing up my ms in computer engineering it always drives me nuts when people ask what i do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering i try to explain it like this computer science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems computer engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems i always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took computerelectrical engineering as undergrads because they generally speaking are simply trying to make x thing work and i am trying to make x thing run as efficient as possible you can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines anyone looking at going to school for computer science should understand this you are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary anyone can learn to code but being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career if you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code you will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks but those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use i hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,negative
wow what a guest i was listening to this guys lectures on python last year he has a knack for explaining complex things in a very simple way,positive
david was my motivation not to give up ever not that long ago i was working on a farm and listening his ccna courses today im managing 6 production servers and complete industrial network infrastructure and got involved in the software development as c dev only by folowing one rule that tomorows myself shall be proud of todays myself thank you david,positive
dr chucks python course is literally how i got started with my career in tech and software engineeringdevops engineering its the same course that i always recommend to people who are looking to get into programming and building a career in tech great interview man really cool to hear you guys sharing your experiences,positive
as a professional engineer i really appreciate your direct tech channel no bs david it is good to hear dr chuck as i stand firm with him as i also teach tech in my free time while i work in tech fulltime i hope entrylevel folks see this,positive
i took his courses and he is an amazing teacher nice interview,positive
absolutely love this i was familiar with dr chuck as an academic and i may have even taken part of his course i spent 16 yrs teaching programming in a computer science programme and he is 100 right,positive
hope yall enjoy the video,positive
bro as a newbie this video is exactly what i needed there are so many terms to keep up with and you perfectly explained all of the basics great video my man,positive
this is hands down the best explanation for programming lingo i have ever heard i wish somebody would have shown me this in 2014 when i started my mathematics degree would have saved me months of frustration down the line you sir are a saint thank you so very much 3,positive
thank you for the basics im new to the tech field and at first it can all seem overwhelming but its really not you helped with that ,positive
more videos like this please it was precise fun and easy to understand,positive
what an awesome video loved how you covered everything thanks,positive
thanks for the video i learned so much about code and debuging the bugs in the code im taking online classes because of covid19 and its really complicated to apply for one because im not techsavvy but you sir made it easier to understand thanks again,positive
that was great where do you recommend we go from here to learn all of the programming terminology like iterations etc anyone feel free to recommend a video for me below thanks in advance,positive
one of the best videos i’ve watched on youtube so complete wasn’t what i was looking forgotta get more accurate at searching but i’m subscribing to your content because i learned the most watching this video and took notes thank you my good man wonderful day to you,positive
yo bro i just wanted to say thank you im going into cs at cornell next semester and your videos really motivated me to get to the position im in today i watch all your videos bro much love ,positive
amazing video man don’t know how this video doesn’t have millions of views you provided some really useful information here and i appreciate it a ton i’m getting out of the military soon and trying to navigate this college stuff for the first time and tips like these give me a lot of motivation ,positive
really important advice just do what you love in the end we all are just humans living in this life,positive
hey man im a junior in hs and looking to be a cs manjor in college i also hope to get into umd,positive
one of your best videos hands down,positive
this series has made me seriously consider computer science as a possible degree optionthanks guysgals of crashcourse,positive
as a software engineer i cannot help but be amazed at how you managed to break the information down clearly and logically to its most important components while still being completely excited and in awe of the stuff you are talking about my old professors and teachers could seriously learn a thing or two from you,positive
her enthusiasm while taking about unicode is inspiring,positive
shes awesome the people behind the animations and editing dont get the recognition they deserve either really high quality stuff,positive
i find this so compulsively watchable even though it features math john,positive
programmer here who finds this series seriously interesting its also nice to see very informed tutor and friendly way she covers subjects in details keep up the good work,positive
man so much love for this series never has encoding or unicode been so exciting also we cannot stress enough how absolutely revolutionary it is for both our operations and the objects of our operations to be encoded basically in the same way the algorithm that encodes your mp3 and the encoded file itself are written with ones and zeroes in a digital context nothing is really subsymbolic anymore everything is written,positive
thank you so much im 23 years old and finally binary system makes sense to me so pleased feels like learning a new language in 10 minutes,positive
my brain hurts and my decision to watch 20 of these at 1am is still not regreted,negative
i learned this stuff 10 years ago and this is the first time it was ever presented to me so clearly,positive
now i know how ram actually stores bits now i can die in peace great content,positive
it completely blows my mind that we can build all of this much less make it the microscopic size we do,negative
i am a computer science major and currently i am learning assembly language my professor is pretty terrible he doesnt really explain anything he just skims over power point slides but these crash course videos have helped me so much and made me understand how the cpu ram and the computer works in general and about the interactions between different components i am really thankful for these videos they also help me understand how my code is interpreted line by line and executed by the computer the relationship between software and hardware is just really beautiful the humans who came up with the computer and improved upon it are really some next level geniuses,positive
this episode is ridiculously wellwritten,positive
with every episode ive been able to say so thats how that works at the end of it cant wait until next wednesday,positive
i seriously cannot get enough of this this is so cool thank you so much to crashcourse i am blown away by this,positive
this is an absolutely incredible way to teach computing i love the emphasis on layers of abstraction,positive
would love to see weighted questions on tests like these,positive
i am so excited i am a sophomore in high school and feel in love with computer sciences back in 6th but now i have finally been able to use my logic skills to make many projects and started building my portfolio it has been a great trip and i cant wait until i get better,positive
after 3 years of studying computer science ive realised its not the right major for me unrelated to this quiz got 3 points btw maybe i should have taken this quiz 4 years ago ,negative
thanks a lot i had chosen computer science as one of my optional subjects and i got an 8 in this which definitely made me feel more confident about my choice,positive
could you make one for physicsspecifically astrophysics or quantum mechanics ive already decided to have my career in physics just wanted to see how many other people would want to as well ,positive
programming can be incredibly creative and selfexpressive its just not taught this way in most colleges unfortunately like its unlocking the full power of a computer so you can make it do literally whatever you want also problem solving requires a lot of creativity and lateral thinking generally,positive
when i took my exams so i can get in a university i really wanted to study architecture or art however things didnt go well and my score was extremely low so i was left with a few options one of them was computer science and telecommunications and tbh despite the fact that i had zero interest in programming before i freaking love this major so much sure its hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works,positive
andrew tanenbaum books on cs helped me a lot during uni years and sometimes during discussions at work but they give theoretical knowledge not practical applications,positive
this is so informative ive been a little on the fence about getting into cs but i love how challenging it is this video really helped answer alot of question i had i cannot thank you enough,positive
hey everyone after some years of experience i know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills a few days ago i had a very interessting nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years the question which fascinated me the most was how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier the reason why i tell you this is because i am very exited about your opinion on this topicespecially the following 2 questions would interest me the most 1 as programmer what are were the 2 biggest issues you’re dealing with 2 regarding your programming skills what would you wish for more than anything else thanks so much in advance looking forward to reading your answers,positive
thanks great advice just starting out pursuing a ba cs after being out of school for 20 years i have been having a similar dilemma i originally signed up for software development but my counselor said i should do cs since i said i want the ability to be hands on on top of developing not sure if i am thinking too big but thanks great video,positive
to hear that you didnt have any preparation before college makes me feel better for being in the same position i really didnt have any experience with code other than html and felt behind because other student because half of them either smarter or extremely experienced with the area,positive
came for computer science stayed for the glorious hair and beard,positive
thanks to curiositystream for sponsoring this video if you want to watch their content and support the channel while doing so go to and use code reducible to get access for 1499year,positive
tsp is a np hard problem but so is making this video every seconds of the video i see an exponential effort invested thank you so much,positive
from the wikipedia page titled ant colony optimization algorithms they have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time this is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems this reminds me a lot of the youtuber pezzzas work his ants simulation videos make sure to watch that it is analogous to the market speedrunning anything really,positive
been excited for this video for awhile i’ve heard of tsp superficially many times but never got a deep dive like this before very motivated exceptionally beautiful and naturally narrated content like this is the gem of youtube just to add as impossible as this problem is it’s wild to know we have a record solution with a tour length of 75 billion,positive
im quite impressed that you managed to avoid mentioning entropy while discussing the annealing approach and the pheromone approach i once tried to explain pheromone optimization to a friend of mine who wasnt familiar with using entropy to backtrack a search and i simply wasnt able to explain the process well done,positive
pspace problems common in planning are arguably harder as tsp is only nphard,negative
as a software engineer i still find this fascinating,positive
congrats carrie youre officially my favorite nongreenbrothers hereafter ngb crash course host none of the other ngb cc hosts manage to hold my interest long enough to watch their stuff youve got a good mixture of interesting subject matter and a pleasant delivery style the gbs are both naturally funny and that works for the i feel like the other ngb hosts try to be too much like the gbs and it comes off false for what its worth keep up the good work,positive
im an it professional still is always good to visit the origins of what we are today keep doing this great job,positive
absolutely fascinating i am loving the course this far the bug thing really caught me cant wait for next weeks episode d,positive
im a computer science student and this is really entertaining to watch good to research background info on my field,positive
thats a fantastic course it made my transition from mechanical engineer to being a software developer smooth many thanks,positive
this is marvellously well done great hosting and editing,positive
yes another crash course classic brewing right here this series is already contending with the philosophy big history and world history series for me keep it up crash course 3,positive
grace hopper is awesome in so many ways but not for coining the term bug bug meaning a technical problem had already been in use for several decades 1800s so as hopper recorded in her journal when she taped in that moth it was funny to find the first actual case of a bug being found it was a good joke after a long day at work dealing with problems basically,positive
this is for some of you incoming freshman who may be worried about cs if u have never coded before i was a freshman data science major last year and i had never written a single line of code i got a c in my intro to java course and i was very disappointed as it was something i really want to pursue i was worried about my performance in the next course software 1 and if my grade would be lower i worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and i ended up finishing with an a in the next course and this was all over the course of one winter break now i’m making apps with swiftui and solving data science machine learning problems in python and this was all over the course of a year don’t be afraid if you struggle early on it’s a part of the journey,negative
my advice as someone who just graduated with a cs degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that youre writing too many times i see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesnt work,negative
i’m starting collegeuni this year in the computer science course this was so timely,positive
another thing ive found helpful as a cs major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gened classes subjects like history english philosophy etc having a spare 100level intro to x class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of javapython can really defray the pressure many of these are also just as good when taken online as well,positive
great tips i would also like to say that understanding logic is very important my professor really stressed this in my first programming class he said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error i think that he is right unless you can explain every single piece of your code line by line you dont really understand the logic behind it in fact he makes us go to the lab and the ta asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment,positive
my advice get into your schools cs discords and class specific discords if they have them or make one if there isnt graduate and undergraduate students work together to give lots of resources for all students and it help a lot especially with what proffesors are good and bad they help with assignments and even answer general questions,positive
thanks again for the opportunity absolute pleasure working with you guys on this steven npe,positive
this 3hour video is my entire 2 semester of my computer engineering such nicely composed video definitely recommend for beginners cheers,positive
i graduated with my bs in computer science 16 years ago and i must say this video is a good conceptual refresher,positive
having been a senior developer for some 15 years now i still found this a very useful recap and great at articulating certain salient points thank you,positive
this guy taught me c python and now ds hes truly amazing,positive
35 mins in i am absolutely engrossed loving the concise breakdown much love,positive
steven this video was awesome you clearly put a lot of preparation into your lessons and the slide visuals are top notch compared to most other cs educational videos you definitely earned a subscriber,positive
i failed my precalc class my first semester of college i did an easier math class the second semester and passed it im ready to try the precalc again even though i failed the class i learned that math is one of the most beautiful languages in the world math is great im not good at it by any stretch i will still conquer this though,positive
the reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard it is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before remembering a few equations like dates in history class nor by just scrapping by office hours are the key to succeess yes but even more important than that you must complete all homework when due and dont ever give up on a single problem then you must practice practice don’t study only practice that way you don’t just know you have complete understanding about concepts much like pointing out a particular color in the room you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing like identifying red letters s t o p means stop how to approach the problem and what equation formula etc to use tools in a toolbox baby,negative
calculus discrete math linear algebra is a must,positive
lmao just changed my major to cs and was nervous for the math portion then i realized i’m not actually that bad at math and i was making it seem worse than it was don’t know if that will change when the semester starts but i’m excited gotta say thank you forrest you’re the reason i felt confident in changing my major to computer science,positive
thanks for the video getting into my first math cs courses and its been challenging but youre absolutely right hard work is what helps you get better at math and understand concepts not memorize formulas,positive
this is a reall helpful video thanks considering i want to go into cs videos about your process to solving complex problems would be great since im doing pure math in school ,positive
hey forrest im starting as a freshman in a few weeks and im wondering what your thoughts are on pursuing a computer science degree online as apposed to a physical college any insight would be greatly appreciated,positive
i stumbled upon your page a few days ago and i must say its been the best learning experience in terms narrowing down specific areas to focus on excellent content,positive
kirby this year really is just the gift that keeps on giving,positive
this is really cool my only gripe is that it’s only 2 player local and not 4 when wireless and online are 4 playeralthough it’s likely frame rate issues hopefully they add 4 player local in the future but other than that the game looks like great fun,positive
finally a game that truly gets me on a spiritual level,positive
i love that elfilin already has stuff in this game forgotten land was just before this so i was really surprised to see the stage as well as the cosmetics,positive
i love the part when kirby is quickly eating the 50 strawberry cake i imagine all this fun stuff from “kirby’s epic yarn” when he couldn’t contain himself from a giant cake i don’t care either gotta love that cake,positive
i love how you can add “dream” in front of any regular object and make it a powerful kirby artifact,positive
ive seen art of foodbased abilities before but not traditional abilities in the style of foods it works unexpectedly well,positive
yo this looks soooooo fun the variety of modes cosmetics competitive coop options etc for 15 yayus i also love the attention to detail references like master crazy hand or the hands in some of the menus at 040 64 needle kirby in 155 a smash bros reference at 254,positive
this looks pretty fun only big let down is it seems to only go up to two players in local splitscreen,positive
the pricing is really good here great job nintendo,positive
sonic can totally pull off more serious stories like in adventure 2 im glad theyre taking that approach with frontiers im optimistic about this one,positive
it seems like theyre actually going for a serious story this time i hope they manage to pull it off the cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to i was pretty sold on playing this game but now im really excited also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out i guess itll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later,positive
whether or not this sonic plays out to what we want it to be we should give thanks to the people that spend many hours developing this game looks great ,positive
im loving the cyberspace stages and story so far nice to see another island in this trailer too cant wait to get this at christmas maybe itll be one of the few games ive 100d,positive
i really really really hope they dont screw this one up like id like to actually hear good things about a mainline 3d sonic game made by sonic team thats actually good,positive
beautiful finally a new sonic game that does justice for the original series the first showcase was strange but this one is definitely better compared to the old one,positive
i cant understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls i dont understand how theres such a massive difference,negative
i always love when sonic is more serious instead of cracking jokes hopefully he takes things seriously in this game,positive
so… this actually looks good as long as egghead doesn’t come back as another villain pulling the strings looks promising,positive
finally a trailer that makes sonic frontiers look exciting,positive
the 3ds is probably my favorite system of all time with access to all ds games and the impressive digital library almost no other system library can compare the library isn’t only large it’s diverse there are bangers for every genre of game all of this is a portable package,positive
i recently started playing kid icarus uprising and apart from needing to take a few breaks to rest my hands i am shocked with how much fun im having with it and im bummed that there hasnt been a sequel made since then,positive
love the 3ds planet robobots true arena is one of the most satisfying challenges to overcome across all games would be 1 on my personal list great memories of playing smash run w friends while getting lunch or wutever else,positive
fire emblem became one of nintendo’s larger series thanks to the 3ds i don’t really play fates or sov anymore but i still find myself revisiting awakening love that game if you can step outside of your completionist mindset you’d probably love it,positive
i was surprised kid icarus uprising isnt on here i think its the best 3ds game its a true masterpiece yet again sakurai developed this game too and a lot of his games are gold hes a very hard worker and has high expectations for his games,positive
3ds just felt so special i didnt expect it but found myself really into pokémon sun and moon i think pokémon refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team and i found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my mismagus held on to the end for me i know it ruins the game for some people the pokémon holding on has a higher rate of stopping ko than the focus band apparently but dont quote me on that but for me it was just want i wanted as a jaded almost30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game,positive
smash on 3ds was a marvel in its own right the fact the 3ds could handle it and at 60fps on the og 3ds was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time,positive
my favorite series is the dillon’s rolling western series i remember going on the eshop to find the last ranger being advertised however i wouldn’t get it until i grew up a bit more dillon’s character stood out when i am already attracted to stylized games all three of the games are tower defense where you are trying to clear waves as fast as possible currently all of the games are exclusive to the eshop unless you live in a pal region those games will be lost to time,positive
kid icarus uprising is my favourite game of all time the combat is fun the weapons are cool the characters are funny and layered and the story and world building is fantastic its been half the time there was between the last two games in the series but i will gladly wait another 10 years to get more kid icarus goodness,positive
i know this will get overlooked but i really wanna give props to the announcer she did a fantastic job and put so much energy into the announcement it honestly made me pretty hyped,positive
i love how the splatoon colour themes are based on complimentary colours opposite colours for example… splatoon 1 orange and blue splatoon 2 pink a green splatoon 3 yellow and purple some of the colours are slight variations such as pink it’s meant to be red but pinks a good substitute,positive
i’ll always love splatoon they never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things we’ve wanted i’m just really obsessed because i’ve always loved this game since i was little,positive
whoever this announcer was definitely needs a raise everything was so easily digestible and i’m glad new players can find their way even easier she sounded so energetic intrigued and passionate overall this 30 minute direct was beautifully executed,positive
im going to miss the idols from splatoon 2 they slayed perfect character design and wonderful personalities i didnt expect we would get three idols big man shiver and frye they seem to have a lot of potential im looking forward to doing story mode too the gameplay must be amazing,positive
i was genuinely afraid i thought the game would be identical to the second or even worse but this direct definitely made me change my mind there are crazy news the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games and i love it new weapons story mode that feels spatial practically a free choice of character customization of much more i have no negative comments the only flaw could be a short duration of the story mode which for lone players like me could be a problem but i sincerely hope im wrong ,positive
the expressions of the characters are perfect and everything looks so lively like the inklings have actually remade civilisation but no humans nintendo doesnt just cease to be awful they dont know how to,positive
the announcer here and on the direct is so good she sounds so energetic and passionate and it fits the game really well and gets me excited to play even more i am so unbelievably hyped up for this game omg i’ve been a fan of splatoon one but i didn’t get a hold of the game until splatoon 2 cause i was poor lol i legit can’t wait to play this every day,positive
i’m definitely interested to see harvestella shown off the concept sounds really cool but the trailer left me with very little idea as to how it would actually work so i’m interested to see more,positive
wanted to wish everyone a happy wednesday today love watching your video game news everyday jon keep up the great work ,positive
i am actually kind of looking forward to harvestella its a very pretty game,positive
the fact that the version of re7 that came out was considered marketings worst nightmare shows you that listening to marketing people is a foolish idea when it comes to creative endeavours,negative
gamescon had quite a few games that peaked my interests but that sony edge controller was the most intriguing looks like we can hot swap joysticks which could be a fix to combat drift,positive
whenever i see a company announce a release date i never take it seriously anymore and almost expect there to be a delay,negative
as term of gamescom i was excited for gotham knights villain trailer and the release moving up to october 21st im still getting day 1 im excited for castillo protocol im excited for sonic frontiers finally getting a release date in november and i loved the new trailer of hogwarts legacy,positive
thank you for adding chapters to your directs,positive
this direct genuinely felt like a love letter to the older gamers thats been waiting 520 years for these ports of megaman battle network persona nier etc,positive
i will never underestimate a nintendo direct mini partner showcase ever again,positive
this was far beyond my expectations it was so surprising and joyful for me to see all major persona games being ported on nintendo switch also some new footage from sonic frontiers ill never underestimate a partner showcase direct again it was best of them all until now,positive
this was actually a pretty good direct good job nintendo you surpised me,positive
i am highly interested in the megaman collection some of my favorite gba games ever return to monkey island could be interesting and just hearing the music is really nice i like the style but its a pretty big change from what im used to seeing kenta looks really charming and adorable i adore the concept dragon quest treasure seems like a real blast i love being able to fight alongside companions it makes me miss dragon quest monster joker theres a lot of promise coming up but nintendo please it was a huge 3ds hit please remaster or remake tomodachi life,positive
nintendo just put out a better sonic trailer than sega did this should have been the first trailer for the game it makes so much more sense than the weird rollout sega did,positive
this might be in the running for the best direct ever so little downtime each announcement was ranging from cool and not my thing to wow,positive
thank you for finally putting persona 5 on the switch i have been waiting,positive
i do quite like how the splatana feels like a samurai stealth based ninja weapon diversifies the gameplay quite a bit,positive
wellworded and gracefully honest it does like quite the quality title im excited as a hardcore splatoon fan i have 670 hours on 2 so small changes still do mean a lot to me after playing the second game for the past 5 years of course it doesnt hurt to want just a little bit more for a sequel im hoping that future additions to the game will help it to become even better,positive
the graphics actually look a lot smoother more intricate and more polished as well as the frame rate and overall flow of movement which is super nice i wasnt expecting a graphical improvement after the first footage we saw but now im happy,positive
i wasnt really expecting any new formula for the single player im completely fine with the stuff you mentioned maybe theyll explore new things in the paid dlc from the trailers ive seen your gameplay you get shot onto the stage for turf wars anarchy battles thus getting rid of team specific spawn areas perhaps thats what made the maps feel bigger cant wait to see how they update the splatoonsplatoon 2 stages,positive
i guess in terms of a single player mode for splatoon 3 i was hoping for a bowsers fury type of world where it feels more grand some exploration and seemless transitions into the levels,positive
i feel like the biggest sell for splatoon 3 is the timing with the switch being as old as it is now most people have a switch in their home so for kids this is a big buy especially if you havent played it yet but all your friends are playing it i havent played in a few years and im really excited just to chill enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it its a lot easier to sell this game to a japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out as well as the irl concerts with their in game idols,positive
i honestly hope its great considering that splatoon is my personal 2nd favorite nintendo franchise behind mario,positive
i am living for the revolutionary joke gonna be giggling about that for a while great breakdown and honest feedback,positive
this looks much better than the first wave waluigis pinball and mushroom gorge make the whole expansion worth it,positive
i remember trying to pass the first pinball in waluigi pinball as a young kid the feeling of accomplishment you got from beating it too the ramp where it falls was great definitely one of my favorite tracks the pinball machine segment the most chaotic place in any track that gets more chaotic every lap which may be why it’s so popular,positive
i’m literally hyped for this wave they have waluigi’s pinball i do find it interesting that they are also creating completely new tracks as well like the sundae one as most people suspected complete remakes of the originals all in all i’m excited,positive
i cant watch this without a huge smile on my face wave 2 looks incredible i still cant believe nintendo is bringing back 48 courses spanning the entire mario kart series and updating them for mk8dx its like a dream so many great memories with the originals ,positive
116 my favorite course from mario kart ds cant wait to race on it this thursday ,positive
looks amazing waluigi pinball had some electrodrome thrown in,positive
this wave looks amazing im amped to play these and relive the past once again i hope they bring koopa cape and peach gardens along the future waves those 2 tracks especially are my favorite tracks to run,positive
these courses have made an already 5 star game even better it’s great they’re including one allnew course per wave too i’d love to see some new battle courses at some point though…,positive
vou comprar o meu nintendo switch esse ano esse canal tem me ajudado e me animando cada dia mais ,positive
tenho certeza que esse switch vai ficar bonito adoro vídeo de modificação do switch coelho  nintendista sem nintendo switch ,positive
ficou muito bonito o switch agora é hora de ver o vídeo do melhor casal nintendista,positive
tô esperando lançar o switch oled nacional pra eu comprar ele  não vejo a horaaaaa quero muito jogar,positive
im honestly super excited for this game to come out the new fusion mechanic looks crazy the story looks engaging it just looks like a very fun time heres hoping the game thrives edit apparently auto correct likes strives better than thrives,positive
this looks insanely good and the battle system with all its complexities makes me go tingly all over i spend so many hours learning all the different blades and how to utilize them in battle in xeno 2 can’t wait to get my hands on this new system it looks super interesting,positive
what i love about the xenoblade series is their integration of their battle mechanics and story line it hits different,positive
this game looked really good i’m a non xenoblade fan and checked out this direct and i gotta say it genuinely got me interested in the series i’ll definitely check this out if i can buy this game,positive
this looks amazing its my most anticipated game of the year xenoblade 2 was such a masterpiece and i cant wait for the next chapter the new battle mechanics look so sick and their is so much variety edit was expecting a typical nopon voice didnt expect riku to sound like such a chad ,positive
i feel like this is nintendos version of the final fantasy series i hope the xenoblade chronicles continues to expand this will surely keep me busy for a long time,positive
ill never get tired of watching this masterpiece direct the game has so much content plus the interlink mechanic is just insane they definitely incorporated a truly amazing mechanic after the driverblade one in xc2 monolith truly never dissapoints,positive
this really feels like a perfect blend between all three previous xenoblade games in terms of gameplay artstyle and world features im starting to really feel it,positive
this looks like the most complex battle system i have ever seen layer after layer of options i am giddy after each function shown i cant wait to play this i will have to buy it and play,positive
i think xenoblade might be becoming the best jrpg franchise and this game might cement that,positive
c’est trop bien j’ai vraiment hâte que je jeux sortent et de vous voir en vidéos dessus ,positive
vous êtes vraiment trop chanceux d’avoir plus de tester en avance,positive
le jeu avec le quelle je vous ai découvert franchement jai envie de pleurer continuer comme ça les goat ,positive

ahhh c’est trop cool vite que le jeu sorte ,positive
excellent excellent votre vidéo j’adore c’est du beau travail merci de nous faire découvrir ce jeu,positive
well im sure this will end up well lol,positive
i hope one day people understand gabe newell once said the easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work its by giving those people a service thats better than what theyre receiving from the pirates truer words are yet to be spoken amidst this industry,positive
questions does the drm appy to anything played on the switch or just some upcoming titles do i need an internet connection to play on the switch im always connected so i had no idea this might be the case will drm make the switch unusable in another console generation or two,negative
this is part of why i stick with the older consoles all these servers network logins and drm stuff just ruins gaming for me i just like popping the game in and playing,negative
it will probably not be an online check drm i saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy drm denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if its running in an emulated environment based on their history using kernelmode drm anticheat bs on the pc i would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo,negative
the thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more ive had a couple of friends with re 8 on pc that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better and for me personally i bought the ultimate version of dying light 2 i really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause i thought my pc couldnt handle it or something but then i tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter i hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch it will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases,negative
its also worth noting that the primary assumption behind drm is that people that would pirate a game if theres no drm would legally buy the game if theres drm thats a really absurd assumption most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer and drm gets cracked in only a few months so the pirates need only wait anyway drm does only one thing and thats punish the people that legally buy the game,negative
the eff is what i said immediately denuvo does not stop piracy it kills game performance,negative
thats exactly what switch games need something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down brilliant,negative
man every year that passes im feeling more and more vindicated in emulation and archiving,positive
with the amount of people obsessed with nostalgia these days no one will actually be nostalgic in a few years,negative
pikmin 3 12 are already nostalgic just waiting for 4 to come out and 3 to become nostalgic,positive
i agree about splatoon 2 being nostalgic even though ive only been playing since march 2022 when u beat the game it feels so good too hear fresh start by the squid sisters,positive
botw is also gonna be nostalgic ,positive
the hype around super smash bros ultimate is something i will never forget it,positive
the game i’m already nostalgic for is botw hearing the theme and watching the trailer just gives me chills,positive
nostalgia is a very personal thing that being said i dont ever see myself being nostalgic for nintendo switch sports,negative
here’s our revisit review of lego star wars with patch 107 hopefully this helps anyone looking for latest information on the nintendo switch version through our all patched up format mark,positive
the fact that you revisit some patched games is one of the things i love most about your channel while i’ll say that many games should not release in the poor state that they do such is the state of the gaming world in 2022 you guys do all of a wonderful service by updating your reviews when possible thank you,positive
it’s easy to be harsh on the switch and the way some ports perform but it’s amazing to have full games like this on the move when developers get it right it really sings,positive
this is why i love this channel they don’t just abandon games at a review,positive
i suppose its because i grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesnt really create a negative connotation for me with a game i know that if a game isnt wholly designed for the switch that issues can occur with frame rates pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games i think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to,positive
a note for your souldiers revisit while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues the fire temple a late game area is still prone to a lot of crashing when saving at dragon swords it was 5050 every time i saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not didnt get any crashes anywhere else so im not sure why that area specifically is so problematic it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch,negative
i preordered this and i didn’t really notice much of the original issues but i think that’s because i was just enjoying the gameplay and i was mainly playing handheld on an oled but it’s always good to see developers going back and fixing things to improve the game,positive
glad the performance has gotten better on split screen i stomached it the first time through but might return to mess around knew this game had potential on the switch,positive
there’s so many things that annoyed me about this game and i ended up quitting well before completion i really like games with tight responsive controls where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your character’s move set this game was like the opposite to that ,negative
i nearly got 100 completion with this game had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief it took a lot of patience but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped it was frustrating usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet so you had to traverse large areas trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me now im stuck on some backlog games so i dont know if ill ever have 100 completion but maybe one day,negative
im so glad that the direction theyre going with when it comes to chaos is pure expression and a sense of warmth rather than falling into the trap of being edgy,positive
it almost sounds like a blend of indian japanese and brazilian culture which really brings out the idea of diverse unity and expressionism that chaos is all about i love it,positive
i absolutely love how chaos is used instead of being like an apocalypse or something the chaos is presented as a huge jumble of culture love it,positive
whoever mixed this song is a genius they managed to fit so many cultures in such a small amount of time and managed to perfectly make fake squid language sound great all whilst making a genuinely slapping song,positive
don’t get me wrong the concert vibe from the other games was cool but this fees like a whole festival and its really refreshing,positive
shiver’s part sounds like traditional japanese songs big man’s part sounds like a bit of brazilian funk maybe frye’s part sounds like it’s traditional from middle eastern and the chorus sounds like samba i’m in love with this song,positive
i love the music but another thing i noticed is how different every idol’s dance was they had their own unique way of dancing according to their culture and it makes me so happy to see a mashup of multiple cultures in one performance,positive
the only bad thing about this song is that it ends,negative
not sure if anyone else had noticed this but when i rewatched this again i saw that the platforms that shiver frye and big man were standing on actually connect together the bottom part makes up a fish shiver’s platform is the head big man’s the middle part and frye is the tail very subtle detail i love it,positive
i love all the other idol songs but i gotta say this song is the one that feels the most like a celebration it has a cultural festival quality to it,positive
malheureusement cest toujours les mêmes promos et les mêmes prix cest soulant a la longue sur le ps store les prix sont gonfler pour faire croire a un eventuel promo il y a 1 mois metro exodus gold edition a 999 euro et la le jeu seul a 1049euros,negative
on parle trop de sony et peut de microsoft ,negative
ac odyssey un des meilleur assassin’s creed ,negative
now to get ready for gamescom,positive
im way more excited to see harvestella than i am for splatoon 3 so im happy theyre going to show it off,positive
very excited for psvr2 gonna feel like that big leap in graphics that flat games dont really have anymore because of diminishing returns,positive
i actually like that you keep it real and don’t scream and shout it’s gets a bit scripted and i feel some people do it for the younger audience which is like the equivalent of offering them candy to get in a van,positive
4616 let’s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative ,positive
honestly the design is pretty nice looking and damn that controller looks so sleek love the white on the console and controller too,positive
i like the lights under the joycon control sticks thats what stood out to me the most it really is a nice looking console,positive
this convinced me that the switch pro controller needs an all white version because that controller looks so nice,positive
the biggest advantage the aya air has over the steam deck is the steam deck isnt available in all countries and regions to buy and this should be so people have the option to get this,positive
hmm id still go with the steam deck this is more expensive and looks like it performs worse the only thing going for it is the oled screen plus i think the steam deck will last longer with its powerful hardware and valves continued support plus im not sure how to feel about aya neo they release a new console every 6 months which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run and they were way too expensive and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the steam deck edit should probably finish watching the video before writing a comment because you said pretty much everything i said haha,negative
its always a good day when a new beatemups video is published,positive
i’m in the same boat i exclusively play portably now so much so that i don’t touch my ps4 anymore i’m entirely on the switch i dreamt of having the yakuza series being portable and working well… but with options like the aya neo steam deck i can have that love this new generation of portable gaming it’s insane,positive
wood thanks for reviewing this and introducing me to a new controller i know you were mainly focusing on the mini streamdeck but still i had never heard of it and i was looking for something like that because believe it or not my pro controllerjoycons all have stick drift so finding a controller that addresses that problem is exactly what i needed especially when its got gyroscope capabilities too i play splatoon so i need gyro and sticks with no drift of course,positive
honestly that tricolour three team mode was what sold the game to me its just a shame that its limited to splatfests only i felt like as a mode that was the truly unique and franchisepushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel oh well i guess nintendos servers wouldnt be able to handle it at the moment this is just what splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017 to me splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel the tricolour mode was close to that principle but alas its only limited to splatfests otherwise stay fresh is just a quote of sheer irony because splatoon has thus far to me not proven to stay fresh,negative
the locker feature the ghost feature and everything else looks so exciting can’t wait for this game,positive
a lot of folks were hoping for an apartment they could decorate and i feel like the locker feature is a good way to address that without distracting too much from the main game,positive
thank god we can finally just queue up with friends on the same team that was the main thing keeping my friends and i from playing more,positive
so many quality of life upgrades gameplay upgrades and things the fanbase has been asking for have now been included this game truly is set apart from splat 2 thank you so much nintendo and splat3 dev team you all did amazing ,positive
the replay feature is actually pretty fire,positive
i already know i’m gonna pull something from dancing to these new songs cant wait to play against everyone as team rock amazing job nintendo,positive
this game is looking fresher than grocery store produce i love the new aesthetic and weapons plus the new features look really fun i also love how you can customize your character with emotes and lockers it fits perfectly with splatoon,positive
i just watch unboxing vids to get that mental high of experiencing something new without actually splurging for it,positive
i remember being so giddy and excited for this thing to come out watching videos unboxings gameplay etc seeing this video again brings back some really great memories,positive
this is amazing no confusing instructions no details missed except the one were how you take the little controls off and the cool thing is that you didnt stutter it doesnt matter but its just amazing how your explanation went,positive
i own a ps4 but i suddenly have the urge for one of this the red and blue design looks great,positive
my brothers have one of each of these and i use them sometimes the only problem weve run into with them is the joycons bugging out with the display he has had to send them in twice for that and they still get that problem but other than that its a great system for us,positive
very clear and thorough thank you,positive
hey just wanted to let u know what an amazing job u did explaining everything this helped me a lot,positive
coucou jadore tes vidéos je te suivais au début par rapport à mes enfants maintenant je me suis mise à jouer à splatoon avec ma fille et comme toi car jadore lunivers hp jattends ardemment que le jeu soit sorti je crains néanmoins la sortie sur switch peur que cette version sois moins jolie je vais me tourner vers la version pc je crois bonne journée,positive
merci edouard pour ces précisions très précises du coup je pourrais le préco demain sur ma xbox série s merci de ta réponse nayko,positive
merci pour toutes ces informations très riches ,positive
f for mr satoru iwata thank you may your soul rest in peace,positive
this f is for respect not only to a great man but to the man who made a ton of nintendo games possible rip,positive
rip mr satoru iwata for such a amazing console,positive
you did a great job just got mine oled version and it was amazing f for mrsotaru iwata rest well legend ,positive
just got my oled model over two weeks and i personally like mines a ton been taking good care of it best gaming console ive own to date ps f for mr satoru iwata,positive
rip iwata i was so sad when he died he was the face of nintendo what a loss but his ideas gave the greatest success to the company and helped them move forward,positive
dark mode was the first thing i check in the settings lol  everything is dark mode for me if it is possible lol,positive
rip iwata a legend never forgotten,positive
rip iwata a true legend ,positive
still happy with my original at the minute i cant compensate paying for the upgrade personally but fully understand why you would go for it as a first time switch buyer,positive
its a bit expensive and i didnt want to buy it as i have the original but my husband bought it for me as an early christmas present and i was able to transfer and re download my stuff overall im really happy with the oled version it feels more sturdy and the graphics are much better i was able to sell my original switch so we got quite a bit of our money back so i say its definitely worth it ,positive
it looks neat the screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original switch and the switch lite i love playing the switch on table top mode with the switch pro controller it feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel,positive
thank you you just gave a good review unlike the stereotypical reviews that only bring up the its just a larger screen and thats it reviews that are bandwaggoning trash so thanks very much for this you brought up a few things i didnt yet know about it ,positive
picked up on oled and very happy with the bigger screen size paired with my hori split pro joycons its feels greatthe stock joycons feel small and uncomfy the screen for my old switch looks like an old cheap tablet now with that huge bezel if you have no fingernails the cart door is way harder to open than the old switch door,positive
i have the v2 but i do think the oled is nice i like how it has ethernet supportand i hear it has a padded dock now which they should of done from the beginning but oh well i play only on my tv so i won’t be upgrading until a whole new system drops but i give the oled a 910def worth it for new switch buyers imo,positive
the card slot is way harder to open on the oled sucks for people like me with short fingernails never had this issue with the original so its baffling as to why they changed it,negative
love my oled such a premium experience compared to the original,positive
if nintendo makes another switch i really hope they make the joycons bigger and more ergonomic,positive
these presents are really what all people need and love thank you so much,positive
my man toby fox did the unimaginable yet again i cant believe he made the music for the raid battle lets gooo 1720,positive
some cool improvements here though i still think the gem forms are a little silly would love to just get mega evolution back those were awesome,positive
this game seems to have a lot going for it three storylines sounds like great idea at least on paper as it would give both fans that want a more traditional pokemon game and those who want something fresh,positive
onix better be in scarletviolet……the dream of having a crystal onix must come true,positive
i feel like the hill to climb after arceus is huge i really liked the independence aspect of the game the catching mechanics that didnt require you to battle and no forced encounter in tall grass which allowed you to see the wild pokémon these new games seem to have kept some of these so im eager to find out how it will pan out,positive
1997 legendary pokemon are elusive to find and even more difficult to catch usually only obtainable after finishing the main game nonstop rumours about dubious methods for how to obtain them underneath trucks etc 2022 vvvvrrroooommmmm,negative
the new terastal gimmick looks awesome,positive
i’m just happy that gogoat is finally in another game such an under appreciated pokémon,positive
lets not deny this guys despite the wii u being a huge commercial failure it had a great library of games its a huge shame the console itself didnt do very well,negative
despite its terrible sales the wii u made up a huge part of my childhood and i loved it,positive
brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now i remember when i was very little i had the n64 where i first played mariokart then i was later given as a present the game boy and then i remember later on i wanted the gamecube which i got i think either for my birthday or for christmas and that’s where i first played animal crossing i played the other versions on the other systems as well i then asked about a year or two later santa for a blue ds lite and a few years later i got the ds i xl which was a surprise present from my grandma and when i graduated from middle school my grandma got me the wii as a graduation present i eventually also got the 2ds only because it was slightly cheaper and now i have the nintendo switch i still love them all and nintendo to this day animal crossing super mario bros mariokart mario party and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day and i can’t wait to see super nintendo world when it opens at universal studios,positive
thank you nintendo for making our childhood memorable i once owned gb color and nintendo ds and i had so much fun back in those days,positive
thank you for this video now whenever nintendo talks about how much of a family friendly company they are similar to what sakurai said when he was introducing terry bogard for smash im going to remind them that they once were a love hotel,positive
glad nintendo is still fighting in the console bussiness despite their ups and downs over the years the gaming world is benefited so much with nintendo in than without,positive
this is probably my favorite game company thank you for making this,positive
considering the games releasing for other major consoles its amazing how nintento still holding its possition as one of the big 3,positive
what does take time to appreciate how much nintendo put into the conslas and still makes it family friendly,positive
fun factthe success of nintendo switch can be attributed to several factors that have come together in favor of the console its hybrid capabilities allow it to appeal to a wide customer base and it receives plenty of support from both first party and third party developers,positive
loved the first two and looking forward to the third a nice alternative to the fps shooters out there,positive
just have to say this is the best “primer” i’ve seen for this game fantastic “coverage” tom,positive
i love the idea of just shooting paint in the scenery that alone was enough for me to love the franchise im glad we already have a third game,positive
it looks really good imo thats what i love about nintendo its always colourful and incredibly fun to play sometimes thats all you need colours in your life,positive
i recommend using gyroscope it is the best option to take advantage in this game,positive
i’m looking forward to this one thanks for your analysis though admittedly i don’t get too tripped up by graphics and performance unless it’s abysmal,positive
splatoon is a lot of fun to jump in and play some games 3 will be the first i play from its release excited,positive
definitely excited for this all the specs aside it’s gonna be a lot of fun,positive
i seem to recall splatoon 2 being a dynamic 900p so it’s nice to see they were able to optimize the game enough to finally make it up to 1080p,positive
the oled screen is so incredible compared to the original my flatmate bought one and i can’t look at it without sheer envy,positive
watching an adult get so excited about video games is my favorite thing ever literally can’t stop smiling thank you for that ,positive
the screen is noticeably better so it definitely improves the on the go experience,positive
haven’t watched this channel in a while and it’s honestly refreshing to see this level of excitement on youtube  makes me feel giddy which i haven’t felt in over 10 years,positive
managed to create a better demoreview than even nintendo could hope to do with the commercials incredible,positive
the oled model definitely looks cool id love to try it out one day,positive
the oled screen is truly amazing and the games look way more detailed,positive
i was curious as to when youd be able to do this unboxing we all knew you were getting one but never knew when youd reveal it well worth the wait ,positive
watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games and after watching animal crossing and pokémon streams i kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability now i think i definitely should save up for this one i like bigger screen option and newer version can’t wait to see it available on local stores as i just discovered i could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iphone 12 also i see this as good option when you don’t have smart tv to play games on like my friends and i even looked up possible laptop connections so this one looks right up to my alley also for when i’m willing to give my phone a break or just feel like playing video games which is something i’ve only been discovering few weeks ago,positive
i actually love every single video that you do…i love seeing the joy and legit happiness that you show,positive
two broken nintendo switches in one video that has to be a record whats the weirdest amazon product youve ever found use my code beatemups10 and link to get 10 off save up to 47 your own authentic japanese subscription box from bokksu dont miss out on this amazing snackjourney through japan sponsored by bokksu ,positive
im not gonna lie the part where you just documented your experiences with real people fixing the joycon is so refreshing and i loved this part of the video please take us shopping or something lol i know were like in a pandemic but if theres an opportunity to do it safely please take it,positive
i love how friendly and cheerful was that retro employee haha,positive
i just love how unexpected everything is going better than any netflix series,positive
retro madness doesnt have much in terms of games but i will definitely keep an eye on them its easy to get retro games here in japan but obviously theyre in japanese ive noticed how hard it it to find a used game store like this on the states so this is a great find especially since they sell online thank you,positive
finding controllers dead randomly happens to me to those batter packs would actually be pretty nice especially if they’re reminiscent of wii motes,positive
subscribe and i might give you custom switches phones ipads cars or even a house like this video if you enjoyed it i will be bringing on more subscribers to compete in challenges and win free custom items we also helped a lot of people with medical bills because this is a video where we wanted to do a lot of nice stuff for childrens hospitals and people struggling to pay medical bills thank you for all the support love you all,positive
yo i remember when we did that with ipads last year that was such a fun challenge ,positive
i love the end where he pays the mom a lot if money she looked so happy,positive
i love how he gives away money and customized electronics to people in need and i fully support that,positive
this man inspired me to work hard on art and i achieved it,positive
bingewatching here you guys are amaaaaziiing,positive
your videos are amazing my man ,positive
it’s so kind of him he does what he enjoys but he also give them away thank you zach,positive
your just awesome theres just no other way to describe youyour truly amazing keep up the good work,positive
i just realized that in every video when zhc works by himself he wins all the time,positive
when i was a kid i used to think you were cool when he was a kid you could bludgeon 12 people to death with each individual peice of first party hardware and itd still work fucking flawlessly consoles handhelds controllers carts that shit was made of nokium it did not break the number of times i threw a controller playstation you could only throw that once they were always the most sensitive xbox until the xbox one you could abuse that shit for five ten years and still see it work when you werent seeing red rings nintendo literally murder people with their gear it did not give a fuck,negative
apparently its because theyre cheaply made the parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile and the buttons are suboptimal shoulder buttons are reported to give out because of poor soldering and lack of reinforcements theres also an issue with wiring as the button and the r button are wired together while the opposite joycon is wired regularly in other words the joycons while the optimal method to play the switch in its entirety are poorly designed for their tasks,negative
iwata and reggie were the souls of nintendo they embodied why every nintendo fan loved nintendo myself included every other gaming platform at the time just felt like they were shoving shit down your throat but when nintendo was showing off stuff it was like they were popping into your living room to show you the stuff they’ve been working on and were so proud of it but when they left all that soul of the company left with them i’ll always be a nintendo fan but that doesn’t mean they’re at the best were i think they can be,positive
“you know when i was a kid i used to think you were cool” this applies to so many companies and people who turned out to be terrible i’ve honestly lost count,negative
friendly reminder that the underpayed and overworked customer support nintendo staff is not in fact the one that is in charge of the design of the joy cons nor the culprit of nintendos greedy practice be civil demand your rights but respect the poor human at the other side of the phone,negative
from my experience my drifting issues have largely been caused by dust blowing into the stick with compressed air or using alcohol to clean them appears to do a pretty decent job at fixing the issue still bullshit that we have to deal with this though and not everyone is as lucky as i am and may need to get their stick repaired,negative
those splatoon joycons are nice,positive
im finally going to try splatoon since theres a free trial and looking forward to harvestella there are so many games i want coming out in september too im looking forward to ooblets disney dreamlight valley lemoncake wyldeflowers potion permit and hokko life so far,positive
hopefully we get something for botw2 probably more of mxr2 maybe a small bit for sv finally some good news to make the week better,positive
dang i just want a normal direct even tho im excited about this i want a normal direct,positive
another botw2 trailer would be great that or wind waker and twilight princess for switch announcement,positive
i’m really excited for the september direct,positive
hey ive been a really big fan of your channel for a long time now keep up the great work but if possible and not to cause too much of an inconvenience would it be cool if you added cst timezones as well i know i could just convert the times online but i would feel a lot better and more confident about the absolute schedule if you were the one who also inputted a central timezone schedule again im not trying to cause any inconvenience only if youre cool with it thanks i really love your content definitely one of the best nintendo intel providers i can rely on and watch almost daily,positive
i want a new mainline super mario game also they need revive franchises like fzero and starfox,positive
zack finally has some good news ,positive
tbh i believe mariorabbids belonged in that list it had a great villain and a great problem creator it also had great battle actions and cutscenes i also love the fact that the villains of the game were mixed together with something to make them who they are,positive
i got my first switch a month ago the oled edition and i gotta say its one of my favorite consoles ever i started with the playstation 1 then the gamecube gameboy advanced sp wii xbox 360 3ds xl then really got into pc games and then stopped playing videogames for many years so it was a delight getting the switch specially because of the great games it has my favorite so far have been fire emblem three houses animal crossing new horizons and smash ultimate also really surprised with mario kart 8 its a lot of casual fun well this is my paragraph that no one asked for lol great video btw,positive
5 years later the switch library is amazing and i have most of these games what a nice list of games great video editing as well luigis mansions animationsgraphics are top tier pikmin 3 deluxe is amazing on that as well and hope more people pick it up waiting on pikmin 4 you have a new subscriber,positive
xenoblade 3 needs the first spot imo such a beautiful and amazing game that actually manage to perfect a system that was already in place,positive
definitely dragon dogma for the best most complex combat system and great character development so many factors come into play npc companions learn player behavior improve can be borrowed from other players and then come back with gifts and trophies and new knowledge class change at any time a game that went down with the release of skyrim but remains one of the best fantasy rpgs to this day the sequel arisen finally brought a few more fast travel crystals into play,positive
im not a big mario fan but paper mario on switch is really really good picnic road and so many other soundtracks are sooooo good amazing game play too clean 810,positive
as a oled switch owner i have to say that it’s a great list but i’d include switch sports and mario party superstars in the honorable mentions those are the type of games that makes the nintendo switch be different than any other consoles in the market the local multiplayer of this little thing called nintendo switch is nasty,negative
as a person who lived through the dark ages of the wii u im so glad nintendo is back making so cool games for us since the switch released,positive
this looks a lot better than the version they showed last year smooth framerate fastpaced action and over the top silliness welcome back bayonetta ,positive
i’m hoping jeanne plays more of a role in this game it’s going to be the first time that she’ll be active throughout the story without being mind controlled she really only appeared in the prologue and epilogue last time,positive
bayonetta deserves even more shine she may not be trending but this third installment will not disappoint,positive
guys if we can see how cool bayonetta looks with her new summons and moves imagine jeanne i can’t wait to see the difference hoping that jeanne is playable and maybe even with her actual voice actor also i’m really loving the new bg music in the first scene it’s such a bayonetta genre of music,positive
the music the story the characters the boss fights in the future… i’m getting hyped for this game owo,positive
looks so good that game clearly looks like platinum was given all the time in the world to make the game as best as they can on the switch can’t praise nintendo enough for keeping this franchise alive,positive
nothing beats the hype of a good stylish action game and this looks like a damn good follow up to two of the best,positive
bayonetta is gorgeous and her style with lady butterfly and her armor is too dopehope that the combat gets some more content besides the trailerim thinking that some nuances and combat systems will show up ingame wellgotta rack up some cash to get this one day one 3,positive
at first i wasn´t convinced with the aesthetics of this game but the more i see this trailer the smoother it actually looks and the graphics does not seem bad at all,positive
i think im the best singer on youtube cant lie,positive
downloading the dlc from nso feels a little confusing so maybe they just got too many complaints or questions about it plus dlc on nso is a key part of the benefits so they just want to have it covered my take,negative
idk man i think it’s smart to tell some parents who are not gamers how to download dlc because it allows them to give more exposure to their subscription which i argue is a great value to those interested in the content it provides,positive
i was recently thinking about what would be next for nsoep and i thought it would be a great idea if gameboy and gameboy colour get launched on the standard tier in september whilst adding gameboy advance and nintendo gamecube to the expansion pack tier in october one year after the expansion pack tier had launched i also think that your idea of super mario odyssey dlc being added would be brilliant,positive
the problem is its not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the mario kart tracks for example they need to upgrade their ux and put it in the switch online section of the os and also message it better my guess when i saw this was that they can see loads of people arent taking advantage of downloading dlc as part of their sub,negative
after going through and seeing the user interface the download button is not as prominent as the proceed to purchase button is obvious i can see people hitting the purchase button thinking that will get them to where they need to go but then they see that they have to pay for it and get frustrated i have some experience with uxui design so that stands out,negative
wave race being here is pretty damn hype hoping we get dk64 and uh maybe goldeneye soon,positive
virtual boy games for nintendo labo would be nice as well as optional colour pallete swaps so you can either play in authentic red scale or have it recoloured to include all colours of the rainbow,positive
splatoon 3 es una experiencia que ningún otro shoter puede ofrecerte aunque todo lo de nintendo evidentemente cuesta dinero ,positive
12709 ehh this line was pretty dumb the game engine unity has nothing to do with how the game feels when controlling my apologies for this one,negative
this isnt the nintendo i grew up loving yeah because you werent paying attention back then easily your most cutting line to date,negative
i really respect how scott is a big nintendo fan but isnt fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgias sake so many of the decisions they make can be so blatantly anti consumer and it blows my mind how some fans will hop in the line of fire to block any shots sent nintendos way being extra dramatic and hardheaded no matter how egregious their actions may be,negative
this video has the scott the woz feel all over it it is definitely a video is it sure has been five years in 1010,positive
the fact that balan wonderworld and breath of the wild came out 4 years apart and both cost 60 makes me unbelievably sad,negative
i’m going to be legit sad when the switch era ends this is the last nintendo console that came out before i graduated i’m having less and less time to play games but the few hours i put at them bring me tons of joy i hope i can have time for the switch 2,positive
i’m seriously impressed how scott can talk for over 2 hours and still keep it interesting even if i can’t watch it in 1 go i still come back to watch the whole thing,positive
this was a joy to watch i really like this series just wrapping up a whole year in sections is a great way to look back this year felt pretty monotone for me i wasnt over hyped for anything and as a pokemon fan pla was cool but bdsp felt janky kirby was incredible kingdom hearts being cloud versions was the biggest let down for me though,positive
cant wait cool to see some prolonged gameplay,positive
319 something i noticed that is so small but such a good detail is instead of abruptly stopping they gradually skid to a stop amazing detail,positive
is it just me or does it look like everyone will be able to dodge roll now and not just duelie mains i think splatoon three is gonna be easy to pick up but hard to master nothing wrong with that though cant wait to meet everybody in the turf war,positive
048 new inkzoka looks cool looks very strong and the 3 shot limit really helps balance it out a bit my question however is if the rainmaker will take on this kind of “triple spiral shot” that the inkzoka has as the rainmaker always takes after the cannon like special in each game would make for interesting ranked matches,positive
i really love the added player titles and medals awarded to the players at the end of each match not to mention the music is hard just 4 and a half months and the wait will finally be over,positive
what i have gleamed from this is that ill definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment the specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes i love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered it gives people a chance who normally wouldnt be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them i personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to longranged weapons when your weapon doesnt have the kit to contend definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you,positive
i can’t even this game is going to be so good the added player titles the new music absolutely slaps and the new victory animations and just everything else,positive
this gameplay is awesome and i am loving the music being played especially now or never it sounds more intense than the other splatoon games really gives off the feeling that it is the last minute of the match and the team that is losing must make a comeback fast,positive
i love the new display and gear the new abilities fit the “city of chaos” get up i like how it shows what weapons we should expect to have their specials can’t wait to see if they release a test fire,positive
the fact this came from kotaku means it cant be taken serious,negative
soo let me get this straight a person that refuses to reveal their identity 1 point tells a very fishy story 1 point without any proof 1 point for a joke that wasnt even sexual harassment 1 point then she revealed her tragic story to kotaku 1 point yeah no lmao i cant even take this seriously,negative
you don’t get to say stray is a racist game and have me take you seriously one of innumerable examples if people really are doing criminalinappropriate things at work then punish them accordingly but until someone with a shred of integrity reports it i will withhold judgement,negative
if she thinks a couple of inappropriate jokes over the course of 9 years is a harrowing experience she must live a very sheltered life,negative
someone making sexual jokes about fictional characters in a chat is not sexual harassment its not even directed at her she wants it to be harassment specifically because shes a woman who was part of the chat,negative
oh kotaku a very very “reliablecredible” source of information with no activist agenda nor creating drama to mine click or dehumanizing gamers doesn’t kotaku have an axe to grind with nintendo,negative
yo automaticamente ya me salto el avance inicial 2min hasta después de la intro y ya tranquilamente escucho todo qué ganas de direct   ,positive
tiene sí o sí prenestar algo sony  y si es así será épico,positive
mario zelda y metroid  mi santísima trinidad nintendera vendrán con todo a romperla,positive
im not sold on the new gimmick and frankly nothing will ever beat the sheer excitement mega evolution gave me but im really looking forward to play both of these games,positive
one day one day id love to watch one of these pokemon presents and have a new shadow pokemon game be revealed,positive
im really hoping we get to battle other regions champions in the end game and who else prefers mega evolution,positive
we finally getting crystal onix,positive
its finally heading the right way arceus was just a tester for this bigger game but they definitely need new hardware and get the graphics and framerate better for on tvs,positive
i’m sooooo excited for “the abundant nature”,positive
one day one day id love to watch one of these pokemon presents and have a new shadow pokemon game be revealed,positive
perfectly said i’ve been bringing up stuff like this for years and i absolutely despise this double standard you can love their games all you want i certainly do but nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them this needs to be fixed not just at nintendo but everywhere,negative
good stuff man people being inconsistent is the only consistent part of the internet,positive
when i was a kid in the early 90s you could still write a sloppy hand written 4 page letter with crayon drawings and send it to nintendo of america and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was and complementing your crappy drawings in detail i think my dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk those days are long gone,negative
you’re 100 right everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day there’s a lot of virtue signalling going on also while we’re at it let’s all admit that as much as people like to hate kotaku at least they’re willing to report this kind of stuff,negative
here’s a hot take most hardcore gamerstech workers who would in “nerd” stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos this is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault andor harassment ,negative
its good to see that youre always willing to speak your mind in a time where anybody that speaks up on anything will be bashed and harassed for being honest the direction things are going in general on speaking out is sad appreciate you and your brutal honesty brother ,positive
i like nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment which happens in too many places men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others,negative
congratulations rgt you’re finally learning what trends are it seems nintendo hasn’t trended negatively like activision has so their opinions haven’t been altered,positive
i miss the days when you unlocked these things by playing the game at your own pace characters and stages were always cool rewards for beating the game’s challenges,positive
congratulations nintendo you did it you added what should have been there in the first place,positive
thank god the queen of mario sportsparty games is finally here daisy deserves better i absolutely love her ,positive
daisy should have been there from the first but i am glad to see more than a single character in these updates 2 a stage and gear its exciting but it also means my expectations were very low,positive
i do really appreciate how new characters still get hand drawn art to match everyone else if all the dlc adds new stages gear and characters then i’ll be coming back to this game for a long time,positive
it’s about time daisy came to this game she should’ve been here from the drop i am so hyped,positive
this is a bare minimum update that should have been there day one i want to see much bigger updates in the future,positive
id never argue with new content entirely so im grateful and happy theyve added what they added here i think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity it would need to have a spectator mode and possibly proper 4v4 online where all players can be remote so that there could be a tourney scene i myself would be hosting them regularly with a spectator mode client but it could go esports if they had a tournament scene like that but like i say im happy for any additional content being added to the game and i hope theyll consider modesfeatures for the updates to come,positive
you guys really need to start releasing your games with full content on release,positive
good to see them adding in more stadiums too not just characters,positive
i dont know why but its so nice seing people get nice things for themselves ,positive
i think that this is the most beautiful unboxing for this nintendo that i’ve ever seen ,positive
very nice,positive
hey just to let u know at 755 u go to press the power button on the switch to turn it on but u can actually hold the home button on ur joy con to turn ur switch on as well 3 a lot easier especially if ur playing docked hope this helps,positive
ngl im not into this whole aesthetics vibe but ur videos have helped me find the right accessories for my switch and have made my days more peaceful thanks peachdudu,positive
oooh the case is so cute i like the peach one too hahah nice to see you uploading again since youre way more active on instagram,positive
the peach joycon looks so cute,positive
all the accessories look so cute,positive
great video love how you style everything so cutely  i really wish to get my own switch oled soon btw where did you buy this tiny white tv looking thing in the back with the pastel buttons,positive
omg that’s so cool congrats on the new switch this was so relaxing to watch,positive
this is the same guy that said a screen protector is useless,negative
its was like i was in space so they dont work because there is no sound in space,negative
reminder this was the same guy that said that a charging portable stand is useless because the switch has a kickstand,negative
a fan for your switch is useless haha heres a dust cover,negative
felt like i was in space in space there is no noise,positive
use other headphones they work just fine,positive
id like to see a 4k docked and 1080p handheld successor to the switch thats backwards compatible and more powerful with better graphics online and frame rate too,positive
what i need going forward is a nintendo switch successor that is backwards compatible and offers improvements to previously released games i need to play xenoblade chronicles 2 and torna over again in true 1080p or at 1440p whether it be 30fps or 60fps i just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed of course this would benefit many other games but i havent ng xc2 because i am hopeful ill get to reexperience improved on new hardware,positive
i actually feel nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the nintendo switch level its the perfect system whether you want a home console portable or both they should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks id also like to see more things the switch could be paired with like linking to discord and spotify and having them run in the background,positive
i wonder if no mans sky coming to switch in october will incorporate some of this new tech weve been seeing more of seems like a game like that will need all the help it can get to run smoothly on the switch im still really curious to see how it turns out likely will either be a pretty solid 30fps or 30fps with frame drops and low res i suspect the low rest automatically in either case but i never played the game so im interested to possibly give it a try if its a half decent port,positive
i still love my switch but after owning the steam deck for a couple of weeks i have to say valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the steam deck then nintendo is the switch ive already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then nintendo has in 5 years nintendo needs to take a page out of valves playbook here,positive
i’d love to see monolith apply this tech either fsr 10 or dlss when the newer model drops in an update to xenoblade chronicles 2 all the xenoblade games are in my evergrowing backlog so i think i’ll wait to see if this actually happens ,positive
so should we do another one of these videos next time  go to for 15 off your order brought to you by raycon,positive
this feels like a special sitcom episode when the whole cast is in another country xd love it,positive
og beatemups style content with a new crowd this is great stuff wood always fun to go along on the hunt with you all,positive
bob’s commentary made this video feel like a mockumentary  also seeing vlog style nintendo content recorded in nyc took me back to the cnd etika days man  such good times,positive
there’s a part of me that was getting the vibe of old cnd vlogs at the beginning there just seeing the store again brought me back to good times,positive
i love this new documentary style its so nice seeing everyone have fun together,positive
god i want to go to the nintendo store in new york so badly it seems like it has so much cool stuff in it,positive
bobs commentary makes everything better,positive
omg just loved hanging out with you guys in this video it really reminded me of the time some friends and i used to go game hunting in são paulo like about 20 years ago thanks for bringing those sweet memories back i would definitely love more videos like this one ,positive
awe the japan videos are the exact time i found you while researching if i wanted to buy my wife a switch for christmas ,positive
ive had my steam deck for about a month now and your reaction to the weight was exactly the same reaction i had everyone says its so big but honestly when you hold it in your hand and feel that weight it makes everything go away amazing handheld,positive
personally i’d much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging i appreciate a company that’s forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run,positive
the steam deck is an excellent friendly competitor nintendos advantage is many great first ip and tons of third parties not to mention name recognition but the stream deck could make nintendo focus on creating a nintendo switch pro or nintendo switch 2 that has more power which i think is great because it puts more pressure on nintendo to do better,positive
i think fancy premium packaging would be cool but i like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses,positive
the packaging feels really nice and valvelike they made it simple and homey if you get me and it feels like a homemade dinner in comparison to the switches package which would be compared to a fancy restaurant the outside doesn’t matter it’s the inside that matters this couldn’t be more true with the steam deck,positive
while the steam decks performance handling these aaa games is impressive id really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects the steam deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try pc gaming and it really has so much more to offer where i feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known smaller and past titles basically pick any random old game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rereleaseremaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console older games often look much better on smaller screens too so many should be fantastic on that little thing,positive
one of my favorite uses for my steam deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console ive always wished the switch would be,positive
this is the best steam deck ive watched even out of all the tech youtubers and video game channels love the up in the video production quality as well wood keep levelling up awesome content,positive
xbox is just going strong and its becoming the most preferred platform pretty quickly,positive
i’m actually hyped for lies of p and it’s day one on game pass man next years is going to be a crazy year for games,positive
when they showed the lies of p trailer and it was coming to game pass and then it was given most anticipated playstation game i laughed so hard,positive
lies of p in gamepass  callisto protocol looks amazing i’m really looking forward to what gamepass is bringing for the rest of the year edit atomic heart is still set to release at the end of the year another great looking gamepass game day one,positive
ps fanboys game pass is full of fodder that no one wants to play also ps fanboys cant wait for life of p,negative
this year looking forward to moonscars scorn high on life darktide solar ash next year and beyond lies of p silksong redfall the last case of benidict fox starfield stalker 2 avowed atomic heart 2 the outer worlds 2 hellblade 2 next es fallout 5 and more so incredibly happy with my pc gamepass subscription so much entertainment and savings microsoft rocks,positive
i doubt well get any new announcements anytime soon and i dont really care about indie games theyre all kind of the same to me they just look different most of the time and about pc feel like they should work more on xbox and not pc and i have pc but thats me,negative
i just can’t wait to play fable that’s really the only game i’m looking forward to,positive
high on life is going to be my go to game the gameplay they showed i believe is the first boss battle my bet the further you get into the game the bigger the boss the bigger environment youll be fighting them in,positive
youre constantly putting out extremely well curated and delivered content thank you ,positive
console exclusives arent going anywhere they would be insane to split market share off of their hardware their ecosystem and ultimately their control nintendo has dominated both sony and microsoft this generation with the unreal success of the switch they are the proof in the pudding that hardware and exclusives are still what drive the consumer towards the platform,positive
destin i think i enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument to the issue of exclusives i think the strategy of ms has already been spelled out what i think ms plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy they will have console exclusives but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is sonys strategy it just means they will release on multiple devices from pcs to tvs to mobile phones and through cloud ms has expanded agreesively but i personally do not think their games will go to sony consoles like most people tend to think because sony are their competition,positive
phil spencer said the day of the press conference welcoming bethesda into the fold that it was about making games available on platforms where game pass exist so this is not anything new hes staying consistent,positive
i liked how they showed gameplay for all their games they showcased gives us an idea of what to expect,positive
this looks awesome im really excited for most of these games i just wish the wait time for release wasnt so long though i respect the hard work being put in to develop them,positive
probably the biggest w ever such amazing games and very well done to xbox for doing this for us xbox better forever ,positive
super happy about the pretty substantial single player games coming out not into online social multiplayer games at all so this was very much welcomed,positive
wow i watched summerfest and was like wtf this could of been sent out in an email this show blew it out of the water so many gampass games to actually look forward to hopefully these games actually deliver in the hype,positive
this game was very beautiful in 4k in 4k we can see very details of the game i hope bethesda continues the good work until the launch of it,positive
great presentation love the actual gameplay footage and variety of games very grateful for game pass love this service,positive
great presentation love the actual gameplay footage and variety of games very grateful for game pass love this service,positive
what do you think about the future of console exclusives thanks for watching and liking the video 3,positive
xbox says “game pass is the future… because we have it”…then “exclusives are doomed… because we have less than none”,negative
considering how well nintendo exclusives sell on all their hardware and especially so on the switch i find phils comments laughable,negative
i have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives i get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform this coming phil along xboxs track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up havent exactly been praised as playstations have been this is more corporate weasel words xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises halo gears of war umim sure im forgetting some others the line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption xbox has doing really well with game pass but they are missing that killer app for the system,negative
apart from lies of p and calisto protocol i really found atlas fallen to be really interesting surprised no one is talking about this new game reveal also absolutely thrilled to learn that lies of p will release day 1 on game pass one of the few benefits of owning both consoles that you get to enjoy the best of both worlds,positive
lies of p looks incredible also dead island looks like it could be good high on life looks very fun it was a good showcase lots of game but also lots of ads,positive
this was a very solid gamescom especially loved the bit of trolling we got from kojima seems like this event just keeps getting better every year,positive
favorite reveal was gameplay of lies of p coming to gamepass day 1 yes looks and feels like its gonna be awesome definitely playing it but yea 2023 is stacked,positive
i knew something was missing out of my daily life thanks for the vids jay your work and content is so underrated,positive
high on life is conker but as a first person shooter im hyped for that game lies of p is the successor of bloodborne callisto protocol looking good sonic frontiers im impressed atlas fallen and dead island 2 oh yea ,positive
pretty good show overall can’t wait for lies of p man ,positive
i agree that the show was average but the dead island 2 reveal made my day dead island and dead island riptide are the most addictive zombie games i have played i played both of them all the way to the end,positive
thanks for watching what consoles do you currently own,positive
just bought the series s it looks great loads fast and plays next gen games ill upgrade in a couple years when the series x is easier to find its worth it people,positive
series s is perfect for playstation players who want to expand their gaming library after getting my ps5 i wanted a cheap way into the xbox ecosystem and this has been an amazing console that i honestly grew to appreciate more than the ps5 due to the small size and price,positive
the deal breaker for me is not having a disc drive when ive amassed a huge collection of physical discs thats why i got the series x however for anyone new to xbox or someone who doesnt own physical discs this is a great purchase,positive
ive owned both and the series s has a special place in my heart i love the x but unless youre rocking a tv that supports 4k120 w vrr the series s is just fine also its so tiny and its amazing what a quiet beast it is but definitely buy the storage expansion card regardless of which one you buy,positive
the series s is plain amazing especially with gamepass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming ive just completed the entire gears series on 360 because i never got to play them back in the day gears 1 to judgment and its been a pure blast you can also find an online list of all the games who received an fps boost including xbox and xbox 360 games so theres that too some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 fps yes my last name is spencer how did you know,positive
the only next gen console i could find was this one have owned it for about a year 0 regrets would buy it again its amazing its form factor blows my mind so tiny but so powerful,positive
i definitely have no complaints with the series s from what ive seen 1440 is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console,positive
i was totally blown away by my series s i still can’t believe what you can get there for 300 bucks still i upgraded to series x because i’m used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money still i would totally go for the series s it’s super quiet performance is mind blowing and it’s pretty small i guess this time xbox is superior to playstation even though everybody is freaking out about ps5 and is probably sleeping on the new xbox consoles though they’re way better x is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer i didn’t expect to be that happy with xbox after being used to a high end pc,positive
needless to say that the series s is actually easy to find and purchase while getting a series x for not more than original retail price is difficult,positive
i love your content animation is smooth audio isn’t weird and bad and the information is so interesting to watch,positive
so much nostalgia i remember every weekend getting out of school going to my friends house and playing halo for hours on the original xbox the good ol days man,positive
seeing the halo game clips brought tears to my eye i remember first playing it on the original xbox and wow best way to introduce me into a game franchise i love being born in the 2000s,positive
when the first xbox came out it had some awesome games on it a decent amount of games as it evolved games started fading for the system it gained way more power etc each time but lacked games with each update lol now we have the ultimate series x microsoft figured since there’s no games for the system for real they gave it the ability to play pc games as well,positive
in a few years when you have millions of subs ill be glad to call myself an og,positive
really well made video packed with useful information and great editing keep it up,positive
when this man hits millions i’ll be happy that i was a part with him through out his journey,positive
ive been xbox ever since the first one and i own all 4 generations of the consoles and in my opinion the 360 was the best one for user interaction as it was simple enough yet an excellent experience,positive
if i were the viewer who sold this to you i would be crying right now as a hobby repairman it surprises me how many times i buy something broken and its just dirty or unplugged baffling really,negative
man that dude got scammed such a simple fix how do repair shops like that even exist,negative
ahh yes the repair equivalent of making sure the device is plugged in  i bet you enjoy these once in a while,positive
nice job steve love an easy one every once in a while ,positive
great content as always teaching a younger generation all about right to fix,positive
honestly i think having the perfect amount of thermal paste is what did it ,positive
great job steve we all need easy fixes hahahaha good luck to whoever wins,positive
i bought a used star wars xbox 360 and the controller they set me had a problem with the left bumper i was inspired by you so i got a screwdriver opened it up and managed to fix it thanks for making the videos and inspiring others,positive
working on railways messing around with circuits for a living i hate troubleshooting when its something simple weve just overlooked last fault i had that i was there for fixing was literally a diode being the wrong way round cost 4 fuse hand tracing and belling all the connection points before finally we found the diode was the wrong way round 2 hours later its always the last thing you check love seeing this kind of content when its an easy fix,negative
malheureusement cest toujours les mêmes promos et les mêmes prix cest soulant a la longue sur le ps store les prix sont gonfler pour faire croire a un eventuel promo il y a 1 mois metro exodus gold edition a 999 euro et la le jeu seul a 1049euros,negative

im more of an xbox person but i still respect playstation,positive
for my personal budget i grabbed an xbox series x primarily because of game pass which has been an amazing experience hopefully after tax season i’ll be able to find a ps5 the sony exclusives are the one thing that i’m missing on my xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol i think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together it’s gamers paradise,positive
i’m a fan of gaming not a fan of a specific company i enjoy both systems,positive
my 1st console was the original ps loved it so much that i stayed with them and upgraded to ps2 somewhere in there i picked up a used xbox because my 1st lan party with halo just blew me away then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what i was willing to spend at that time so i turned to nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems getting the xbox series x was an easy decision for me i have nintendo switch for my exclusives strategy and rpg needs while the xbox satisfied my craving for fps and games that required higher processing and graphical power,positive
i like them both like they both have great exclusives and great hardware and stunning traffics where it is hard to tell the difference between reality and non reality they both are amazing systems,positive
you quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play that is a win for the xbox because it has direct integration with pc you can chat with anyone on pc but also directly play with them in a slew of gamepass games that silently support crossplay between pc and xbox playstation is doubling down on the walledgarden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization perpetuating the console wars really no brainer microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience including online,positive
you are absolutely brilliant at reviewing stuff clear and concise,positive
this looks really fresh definitely gonna check this out in release,positive
this looks absolutely ridiculous im all for it,negative
theme art combat everything looks so well crafted wish the story too holds up to make it an awesome game,positive
this game looks very promising theres not many dark souls clones that actually succeed but this has potential,positive
looks insane big win for gamepass,positive
this seems too good to be true beautiful and very unique aesthetics with souls combat mechanics fingers crossed for this one,positive
another elseworld style videogame im excited to see what they will do,positive
so far the coolest thing i think ive seen in gamescom this year ,positive
absolutely cannot wait to play this day one on game pass man this looks amazing,positive
i was once in line at a gamestop to buy a used ps3 when a guy got in line behind me to trade in his ps3 so i bought the ps3 off the guy for less then what gamestop was selling them and more then what he would have received from the store we both won on that day,positive
as someone i used to work for gamestop my advice is to always buy the used system over the refurbished ones the refurbished ones were broken at one point and whoever fixes them doesnt do a great job,negative
i was a manager at electronics boutique 20 years ago and we had the same problem with the ps2 “company refurbs” and they usually didn’t operate i told my staff to unpack them when they came in immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out we had gotten burned too many times and i wasn’t gonna put my customers through that anymore,negative
i sold my xbox one x a few months ago on ebay and whew this video makes it seem like i really sold mine for far far too cheap im one of those people that keeps everything including the foam wrap plastic bags and twist ties so the console looks pretty darn good once i get it all back together i can imagine that the only reason youd want to buy from gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong and familiarity also they dont know me but they know gamestop,positive
i worked at gamestop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs i’ve seen the first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in it’s common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out i bet it’s missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because it’s been resurfaced in some way the second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes with these consoles very little is done before they’re repackaged and sold,negative
i used to work at gamestop and i can say they didnt give us enough packing supplies to ship out orders,negative
i hope there will be more games hitting 120fps at at least 1440p if not with the series x then definately release a pro midgen refresh asap,positive
i would love to see a series x pro version with a bit more power to run flight simulator properly especially with so many addons that tax the system and a increase in fps for flight sim would be great,positive
i think a pro series x with wifi 6 and more powerful chip would be nice they could keep the same ssd,positive
i think game pass will have 35 million subscribers at the end of next year all the game releases and activisionblizzard games in game pass will surely add alot to it,positive
its nice to see a channel dedicated to xbox so many other channels are all about the switch or ps4 and 5 ive always been a huge xbox fan and i love my series x,positive
the medium ground of these two consoles would probably be a xbox series x sized console or thinner but slightly more powerful than the series x is,positive
im a huge playstation fan picked up the ps5 day 1 i just picked up a series x a few days ago and i gotta say im pretty damn impressed get both if you can,positive
i am all for a series s plus having a disc drive and more storrage must buy,positive
was very interested in redfall when announced loving the new details and thought put into the game a day one for me even if on gamepass,positive
gamepass is such an amazing servicei mean at first it was ok but now and next year …wowcan’t wait for all these games to release day one,positive
there is no loop hole for how death stranding made it to game pass pc as some have already commented 505 owns the pc rights so theyre free to put it on anything they want sony owns the console rights to ds so this is why it will probably never come to xbox consoles unfortunately,negative
redfall is going to be sick ,positive
hell yeah cant wait for gamescom,positive
game pass has been a great service for me i love all the games that come day one that save me so much money by not having to even buy them it’s great,positive
i play on pc ive been a console gamer forever since 1985 but i built a pc recently with an 11600k and a 3070ti i play my xbox on pc i call it my series pc redfall is looking awesome,positive
dang they are sweating the details that looks fun and the fact you can solo play awesome,positive
even though i dont have children or any family members who have an xbox series s or x i think the family plan is a great deal i am cool with paying the 15 a month for just myself though,positive
this is awesome i can’t believe they’re doing it as they have no real monetary reason to do it other than consumer good grace,positive
personally im stoked for the family plan,positive
would be nice if the family plan had different levels that we could pay for so we can pay for how many people we want to share with in our family so if i only have 1 person i want to share with then it should be cheaper than a family plan that allows 5 people to sharethis would be great imo,positive
this is such a great feature,positive
series s game pass is the most fun ive had with gaming in many years,positive
if only microsoft has a phone plan for all carriers honestly i saw it was for verizon but i want it for boost mobile so u could pay your phone plan and including the plan with a monthly xbox live service so every month u could just plan your phone bill and be able to play on xbox,positive
i want my xbox s to be a always online server for gaming and with the new deal with unity maybe some game dev oooooo,positive
well we do have some really bad ass games on game pass already and if they aint planning any new additions this yr we should be good honestly its not a big deal for me personally  i run both xbox series s and x which honestly its been more series s than the x and ps5 so im good on games lol  dude i have thousands of games already on both platforms  so yea and atm im back on forza horizon 4 and 5 and elden ring and dark souls 3 and demon souls remake so ill be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on gp im ok and im sure many of us are xbox has been really good to us ya know they take a huge hit just for us to have fun and thats why i love xbox they truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series s and x and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it yeah games on xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps4 n ps5 ect but still they do good by us with game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series s n x and i dont understand why ppl are shit talking the series s dude i love mine i have 3 of em   and it can do 4k microsoft already said it does lmao and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your tv go to settings display settings and select 4k 60hz or 4k 120hz what ever your tv or monitor does and then start a game and then take the tv remote and hit the ok button your tv will tell you what the series s is putting out to it mine shows 4k 60hz hdr10 dd and the games look beautiful and smooth yeah its not as nice as the series x but its def not 1080p its a higher resolution 100 and i dont see how someone can get 1080p by looking at it lol 1080p dont look that damn sharp n good lmao and just look at the ps4 pro specs the ps4 pro is a 4k correct well the series s has better specs has better hardware the same or a lil more tflops as well the series is is a zen 2 which is a amd 3k series a rtx machine it will do 4k just not as well as its bigger brother the x,positive
045 i miss this i used to play a lot of halo with my brothers i was 6 or 7 back then and never realized just how good i had it this sound kinda just sums up my amazing childhood and the golden age of gaming that just isn’t the same nowadays,positive
046 this this is it this gave me so many memories,positive
the good ol’ memories of the og xbox and 360 startup ahh good times,positive
the 2001 original xbox was my first one got it in 2004 though because i havent heard of it until the fall of 2003 from my uncle besides halo now here i am at 25 still loving it,positive
045 one of the best sounds to hear as a kid,positive
that og 360 startup was sooo fresh as a kid,positive
i was 6 years old and would spend hours watching my brothers play skyrim cod black ops 2 multiplayerzombies prince of persia minecraft batman dead space black ops 2 holds a very special place in my heart even tho i never really got to play those games just watching my brothers play em was fun enough for me i would do anything to go back to those days to get excited whenever i heard the xbox start up sound even tho i couldnt play games till i was older just watching my brothers gaming adventures and playing online with my other brothers that was fun enough for me brings back alot of nostalgic memories,positive
045 the nostalgia from this sound alone makes me want to cry,positive
i still own my xbox 360 because there are games i still enjoyed playing from them the startup still sounds breathtaking,positive
these are so helpful i wouldnt know about more than half this stuff if it wasnt for these weekly updates,positive
cooking sim was bugged to hell for me two point campus was quite fun ,positive

what a beautiful disco mansion i am envious of your takeout boxes and other lovely junk and that shoutout really caught me off guard thank you,positive
the amount of innovation that goes into using all these random scraps and pieces and bringing them together into one beautiful piece of artwork is just mind blowing,positive
your ingenuity and resourcefulness driven by your creativity is every bit as impressive as the video content and video quality im glad i found your channel this was super fun you put the same effort and creativity into the video as you do the project no wonder you have over one and a half million subs seriously you should be super proud awesome job friend thanks so much for the content 3,positive
dude the editing and footage variety is top notch really enjoyed watching this very very good and of course awesome build crazy,positive
youve really come along ways over the years love the editing style and the projects,positive
thrift shop cashier what are you doing with all this random unrelated junk martina my goals are beyond your understanding,negative
this looks amazing and watching you construct the whole thing was really cool makes me wish i had a custom housing for my ps5 awesome work keep it up,positive
i’ve seen some mad stuff in my time but you literally took the saying “1 persons junk is another ones treasure” and turned it into something awesome video presentation is engaging and fun i really enjoyed that video ,positive
martina you are so inspiring and i love the way you are doing this stuff with so much fun,positive
insanely cool using old rubbish and second hand items is also very admirable and cost effective i imagine,positive
i hope your next mystery tech will feature an extreme off brand pc parts like from psu to monitor,positive
wow that miniature cyber quad seems like a better atv than the real one perfect for urban areas and trails,positive
i like the mini xbox display i like how portable it is,positive
these episodes are so fun to watch the personality is great between all members,positive
this might be the most fun theyve had in a while on mystery tech,positive
i feel like that piano was the most fun i have seen you guys have in a long time,positive
everytime i watch austin and his team i feel like theyre a bunch of nerds assembled i love it ,positive
that was one of the more fun mystery techs for ages,positive
getting blamed for unrelated issues sucks but sometimes karma does work especially in the automotive industry being a technician for example someone will come for a multiple cylinder misfire and when all sorted youll now be blamed for the rear passenger windows not working ಠ︵ಠ,negative
the way you remain calm and tell it as it is makes this brilliant to watch,positive
great video towards the end when you talked about the customer that brought the device back for something else i greatly like the metaphors you gave him such as the mechanic ive only have one customer that did that to me and i told him as gently as possible to never darken the entry to my shop with his shadow again nice to hear your kinder way to approach this,positive
more over alex exposing us to a lead solder smell and grinding dust,negative
great story on the ps4 fix with the controller problem afterwards had these kind of situation so much at my previous job,positive
amazing work great fix you just cant help some customers you have to ignore that so you dont get too annoyed about it its enough if you have to get angry about such statements this is also a learning process like your example with the uv light over the camera just dont think about it too much great video thank you,positive
i really don’t understand people that argue over which systems better i’m into videogames not companies that don’t even know i exist except as a number for sales i have and will continue to have any xboxps and nintendo loyalty to any of those is ridiculous trust me guys they care about your money not your loyalty,negative
the whole 360 missing achievements is been around for a long time but you can reunlock them and still works lol,positive
been with xbox since the very first one baby,positive
if there is truly a way i can play marvels spiderman 2 on my xbox series s when it comes out i wont save up for a ps5 cause i lowkey dont want to work so hard to an over priced ps5 for pretty much one game,negative
honestly i think google apple amazon and facebook should really ramp up there cloud system for games and lure game developers to release games on there cloud stadia could have done better,positive
dinhoouuu achei muito interessante esse jogo lies of p gostaria muito de assistir um vídeo especial seu trazendo mais detalhes desse game ,positive

and this is why i don’t show my brother dhar mann videos,negative
gotta love how chill the dad is,positive
i wanna show this to my parents but i also want to live,positive
hearing the 360 always gives me a huge load of nostalgia,positive
the ps2 start up gives me goosebumps every time that was my childhood edit and gamecube almost forgot about that one,positive
10 years from now all these startups are going to be extremely nostalgic,positive
the playstation 2 startup menu just gives me an unthinkable amount of nostalgia just the sound of the startup gives me goosebumps i remeber playing sonic steet fighter and all sorts,positive
422 is the most nostalgic for me that was the only console we had other than xbox360 but i never played it and it was very fun,positive
gaz is spot on in regards to xbox marketing it is an xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either nonexistent or incredibly limited they have a good product with a good service and software yet in many europeans markets they are being outsold 101 because they either dont know how or where to market their product or their budget is super limited,negative
thanks for a other great show guys ,positive
i have a feeling perfect dark will nail the future forward atmosphere that was what i wanted from initiative in the 1st place something new and refreshing,positive
the reason the digital and physical games cost the same is because the retail stores thru a fit if people could buy the digital game cheaper the stores would be stuck with the disks,negative
hey guys love your work i went to preorder modern warfare 2 from the xbox store yesterday and was quite surprised to find that it’s priced at £6995 have you covered this i think it may be the first £70 xbox game i’ve come across,positive
when a game says their new game is bigger than their last game the people whining saying a bigger map means the game wont be dense are just complaining to complain they do not know shit if the game is more dense or not that is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance i guess i am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous if the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some bs comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much i truly like how gaz does not hold back on any side playstation or xbox n will tell it how it is that is refreshing but him bitching about the red fall map when he didnt even watch the new 21 minute video the studio put out plus their was some new shit being show so i dont even know what colt was complaining about that arkane did not show anything new in the video when they had the chance to or whatever he was saying,negative
im a gamer of all consoles i have only ever had to do one return and it was on playstation had my money back in my account in about 45 minutes i was surprised love gamepass have a great day ,positive
id could make a good blade or arkane they did a great job on dishonored prey deathloop,positive
you did a great work with this new makeover colt and gaz look incredible now see i did say it will be clean and niiice  the audio sounds alot better imo now xstalkerx dk on xbox,positive
i think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially when you look at the number of studios microsoft has been acquiring and with fewer cross gen titles limiting devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles,positive
i’m very happy with my series s and i’ve been all about physical media before i got it i do plan on getting a series x eventually but i’ve just been playing digital games on my xbox one most of the time because of game pass ultimate after thinking about it i realized my physical library on xbone was substantially smaller than my ps4 library or switch library so i didn’t really feel bad about getting the series s and an external hard drive even though my 360 library was pretty big i’ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like 3 each digitally when the series x becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper i’ll get one but for now i’m really enjoying my series s,positive
as someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,positive
i have a decent amount of physical games from the original xbox 360 and one so i feel justified getting the series x especially because it has superior fps at 4k resolution the problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series x to its limits yet if you still have a one x and plan to get a series x later and can wait you can update the internal hdd to a sdd on the one x it’ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the series s the one x has a better graphics card than the series s previous games optimized for the one x will look better on the one x than on the series s however cross platform games are probably going to have a better fps than the x do to the better cpu there’s a lot that goes into this stuff another factor to consider is the quality of your tv i’ll be looking to pair my series x with a new oled tv here soon and then i’m 200 sure i’ll feel justified with the purchase also i game a lot so 30 60 120 frames a second… i notice the difference and in no way shape or form would i feel justified having a next gen console series s that can’t even keep up with my old 4k tv,positive
thank you for sharing your experience with these consoles and not fan boying speaking your truth will help alot of people who are on a budget people constantly spread the narrative of digital games are horrible but why when the majority of the world doesnt but movies or music im all for digital downloads and will only purchase physical games if its attached to a special edition that im truly a fan of,positive
in your own words do i really want an xbox no do i really need an xbox no but i feel like i work hard and i deserve it in reality since the day you stepped onto the xbox series platform you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didnt really want thats foolish logic the next time you dont want something dont buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it,negative
i bought a series s when it first came out and a 3 year gamepass subscription was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games so i decided to sell the s and buy the series x had the x now for a year but the other day i suddenly realised that i hadnt turned on my series x for a week and before that it was just sporadically so decided to sell but i didnt want to completely move away from gaming and i managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a series s 140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition going to sell that which will make my series s end price probably around 60 euros cant get better than that for casual gamers like myself the series s is a fantastic console,positive
big mistake i own both the x box series x and ps 5 and alot of the older games from previous gen releases run and look alot better on the x box series x even some of the current gen titles look better on x box series x also microsofts recent buy outs with bethesda activision and potentially other gaming software companies means future releases like cod and skyrim releases may be x box series x exclusives,positive
got my series x on friday and i’m really impressed with it the visuals are jaw dropping,positive
i went from a one s to the series x and the jump to 4k 60fps is pretty significant everything feels much smoother and everything loads faster thank god for ssds the only issue is that there arent really any games out right now designed specifically for the series x with the exception of the medium aha,positive
ive been a lifelong playstation fan but after looking at the beauty and power of the new series x i just may get one im enjoying the ps5 too,positive
as a huge playstation fan that packaging is another level ,positive
i’ve had my series x for a week and i’m still in love with it the visuals and overall gameplay of the games are amazing i can’t stop playing microsoft flight sim because of how beautiful it looks and how well the console runs the game strongly recommend if your an xbox fan,positive
great job here man that is so beautifully lit filmed and cut it looks literally perfect would you ever consider making some tips how to film like that re the series x its such a shame supply sucks ive been lucky enough to source one but its such a wonderful machine that should be in so many more houses,positive
just got the xbox and my friend got the ps5 and honestly they did amazing with both consoles it’s at the point in time that it doesn’t really matter what system you have unless u want exclusives all games now a days are crossplay love both systems ,positive
thanks really helpful i just got my xbox one series x and like how you walked through the unboxing and setup,positive
i wonder if i killed the unboxing experience for myself after watching every single unboxing and review on youtube lol,negative
as a member of the playstation community sending nothing but love,positive
you know you can just get rechargeable ones for xbox i have two and it’s great some people just like using batteries but every one is different,positive
ive been using rechargeable batteries for over 12 years and i can use them for other electronics as well,positive
you know if you just spend an extra 1020 you can buy rechargeable batteries for xbox controllers ,positive
you know you can just get rechargeable ones for xbox i haver two and its great some people just like using batteries but every one different,positive
man put batteries in the wrong way,negative
as a playstation fan i really hope the deal goes through they’ve relied on cod marketing to boost their sales since the beginning of the last gen sony will have to innovate and become more attractive in other more interesting things than cod,positive
this is ridiculous does sony not understand the deal is going through no matter what it’s business playstation does it all the time,negative
i personally like that xbox is being so aggressive i got tired of them playing nice a long time ago especially considering that sony has never extended to them the same courtesy,negative
the part at 500 explains it clearly this is why i have such a huge problem with sony right now the sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by ms changing the industry and now sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it,negative
thats the console war we need this kind of competition gets the best out of both companies and it means ws for all of us consumers,positive
i primary play on ps but recently got back into xbox for the first time since xbox 360 so i’m happy to see xbox actually do well because it pushes sony to do better when i see twitter i see so much venom from both sides and it’s super sad to see i just love video games man why can’t we just enjoy it,positive
i have both playstation and xbox and i like how this competitive climate is forcing change on both sides microsoft was foundering during the last generation so they introduced game pass which forced sony to step up their game with ps plus competition ultimately benefits the consumer things are getting spicy with these acquisitions but being on both platforms im content to let them duke it out for my money,positive
boy that escalated quickly i mean that really got out of hand fast – ron burgundy,negative
documents like this are why microsoft have the best lawyers in the world they go through it with a fine tooth comb and they’re like “yep send it”,positive
ssundee never disappoints to get everything into among us,positive
great job phill u did great on this mod,positive
ssundee we love your videos me and my brother love watching you you take among us to a new level of fun we love them keep up the good work,positive
he’s so good at among us,positive
i love lookums accent,positive
thank you so much ssundee for making daily videos you bring me so much joy in this whole pandemic,positive
thank phil for putting sonic tails and a chao in the mod,positive
the guitar hero reference was all i needed thank you,positive
655 i’m still laughing at this part of the video,positive
for the past year i’ve only had a nintendo switch i’m a playstation guy but found the series’s s at an incredibly low price so i had to buy it so far next gen gaming is great and this video is a big help to someone like me who is not only new to next gen but xbox in general thank you,positive
a few of these are applicable to xbox one and have been for a couple of years especially the googlealexa voice control and the app based functions i didnt know about programming universal remotes to your xbox thats cool,positive
kudos to people like you who make videos like this to inform people of what theyre missing,positive
these consoles are so impressive it’s like “if you know you know” so underrated,positive
i’m so glad i managed to get a series x had it about a year now and love it have not played games since the xbox 360 days and i can say it’s a massive leap haha,positive
this was extremely informative great information ,positive
i noticed when looking at my recent captures in the xbox series s that some of the screenshots on 4k games claim to be 4k or in some instance 4k hdr which i thought was interesting,positive
thanks for such informative video i just got a series x few days ago and i’ve learnt many new things from you video appreciate the effort,positive
half of this applies to the xbox one already some is cool and new though,positive
on the series x i hate how if you have a enhanced game saved somewhere other than the internal or the hard drive for the back it will always want too update the same games over and over,negative
the fact they managed to get lies of p into game pass day one is nuts at this point xbox can damn near get any 3rd party game into game pass,positive
you know dirt i can honestly say im literally overwhelmed with good games on games pass just finished sniper elite 5 loved it bout to play thymesia and midnight fight express and i absolutely know its going to get even better in the months to come great video brother keeping it real as usual thanks,positive
almost every industry is going subscription based why wouldnt gaming its going to happen and at least microsoft is at the helm and doing it right i feel completely respected as a consumer and it seems to me to be healthy for gaming,positive
microsoft acquiring these studios is t just about games its about the new virtual metaverse micosoft and zuckerburg are trying to build and having companies that already work in this industry will pay massive dividends later,positive
still cant believe sony is crying over games going to xbox gamepass you cant make this stuff up,negative
its about the cash tencent makes more revenue annually than both xbox and nintendo combined and they make zero exclusives and saying you pay more to support the devs is like saying youre glad to pay more at the gas pump so you can support exxon and the people working at the refineries its so dumb,negative
sony had a 26 drop in software sales and had to lower sales expectations for 2022 they arent even supporting the developers themselves,negative
good to see aa and aaa games coming day one to gamepass thats what real gamers want to see not these pissy little indie garbage like cooking simulator microsoft gamepass was firing on all cylinders in 2021 they need to bring that energy back because 2022 has been a very weak year for xbo but atleast they got us looking forward to 2023 ps high on life was delayed its not 2022 anymore i believe,positive
you sir just hit nostalgia heaven for me,positive
i loved that the old dashboards were so stylish back then i hope we get a new one in 2021 for xbox one and xbox series,positive
the original 360s dashboard was so cool looking id like to use it over the latest one,positive
something that always seemed better to me about the 360 ​​over ps3 was its interface it was better more modern and more intuitive,positive
i’m a huge playstation guy but one of my favorite things about xbox is their startup screens they’re all uniquely amazing,positive
for me the sounds are whats taking me to my childhood thats amazing,positive
grateful that i lived through the golden era of gaming,positive
even though i never had a 360 it’ll always be iconic cause i remember going to friends house or my cousins house and booting it on to play minecraft or halo,positive
315 i grew up right here and i am proud of it,positive
i honestly can’t wait to play it on my series s,positive
now this looks amazing praying sega delivers with this game,positive
hope this turns out good ,positive
really hyped for this one,positive
cant wait to pkay this on my series s ahhhhhh,positive
then enemies give me twilight princess vibes ,positive
looking better but i will still need to see reviews after that first showing,positive
was i the only one foaming at the mouth while watching this phenomenal showcase,positive
holly sht this trailer is amazing i hope that this game will be amazing,positive
thanks for another amazing update ,positive

anyone can play happily even if the xbox is old or new,positive
i love how adam said wassup guys im lankybox so does it mean he’s admin and justin 26 seconds in,positive

in this the only thing you find out is who the better players are that doesnt mean the player that won his console is better that just means the player is better overall am just sayin,positive
ngl i’m enjoying this videos a lot i think u should do more console it switches things up instead of playing with pc players this better entertainment keep it up,positive
the reason for the input delay is obtain the drivers windows is owned by microsoft with xbox too so drivers are found much easier than sonys way of obtaining drivers,positive
series x has been great for me with variable refresh rate and 120fps it is a massive improvement in performance than my previous one x,positive
i love when jerian makes videos like this ,positive
i think once developers start to use velocity architecture mesh shaders direct storage fsr20 vrs20 the full toolset then we will see some amazing results from this little beaut especially as the biggest issue is lack or ram which with direct storage n velocity they will able to use the ssd as a virtual ram pool the console has a lot of potential but depends if the developers use the toolset available to them when the features become available especially as we know the gdk is new for this gen and a lot of features are still being developed and improved upon,positive
i think for the price i got mine used for 180 euros paired with a nice 24 1080p ips monitor the series s is very good value as you said i have found forza fsx and halo to run great to your point regarding storage space i also agree that just having space for the couple of games you are currently playing is perfect on previous xbox consoles i would find id fill up the hdd with loads of games due to game pass and a few other purchases and never got time to play them properly oh lets not forget the series s is a fantastic emulation box more than capable of running many consoles,positive
i have a pc with a 3060 in it i have a nintendo switch and i have a series s i have never had an issue with how the series s runs games because my xbox is mostly for game pass and games that run perfectly fine on the console like nba 2k optimizations for new console generations take quite some time and im patient and it is not a new issue the ps4 had its issues the xbox one x had its issues they were fixed people complaining should calm down,positive
for weeks i was using the series s as my main console unintentionally because it turned out that i was playing more where i thought i would play less i had no complaints it was really good i eventually switched but its not like i felt there was much of a problem,positive
i got both i got the sx in my living room and the ss in my guest room the sx is my primary gaming machine while the ss is setup to be more of a streaming device even if the ss gets left behind because of gaming advancement it still holds value as a multimedia device,positive
i bought my series s on 21st jul 2022 its my first console ever and been almost a month since i got it i absolutely love it idk why i see people complaining about the resolution i got it plugged in on my 4k 55 tv and boy games look amazing i have been playing halo infinite forza horizon 5 fifa 22 hades two point campus ori and the wisp turbo golf racing and after all these games i still have around 143 gb left so no complaints about storage either i am totally enjoying it,positive
i absolutely love the portability of the series s,positive
these next gen consoles shouldve shipped with more storage to begin with especially considering theyre backwards compatible with last gen but atleast xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device if you dont mind moving games id suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive like the sandisk ultra fit you can easily fit 2 on the back usb ports on the xbox giving up to 1tb of more storage while still having room the expandable sdd too plus you can play the older xbox one games off the flashdrive sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive however using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space meaning its easier to fit in an entertainment center plus it makes it easier if you move your console often,positive
quick resume is a god tier feature pc my main platform but damn the quick resume on my series s is something else brilliant for getting in quick games before work when youve not got much time,positive
im just happy to get constant improvement to the system big pat on the back microsoft for doing this,positive
the only negative i’ve had with streaming a game is the image quality can be quite lacking some games look better than others tho you can’t beat downloading every graphic related file,negative
great video today ray i enjoy many of your videos to get my xbox fix nice interview today i love seeing a dev’s perspective on their work or other games on the market keep up the great work dude,positive
props to microsoft they are truly killing it this generation hopefully sony will step up their game instead of slacking behind the entire time or even better drop their exclusives on pc day 1 with another subscription,positive
one very unrelated subject that annoys me even though i would love that every game had the play anywhere feature i get microsoft can’t really force third party companies like ubisoft to jumó aboard they make a lot of money from people having to rebuy the same game but atleast there should be a way to keep your progress i jumped from xbox series x to a mega high end pc build and i have lost every single bit of progress i had in every gamr,negative
i think its a good game but not all games need to have new stuff all the time,positive
i have a 22 ultra i use for emulation and cloud gamingstreaming my series x with wifi 6 and controller plugged in fh5 has been very very playable compared to even a few months ago and i’ve had a blast on the go with rpgs like kh3 etc it’s so very close we are almost there guys,positive
if you were concerned about the loss of ownership with regards to software and game pass type services the streaming game service should terrify you streaming service makes sure that only the provider controls your content,negative
thanks to everyone who sent me this topic and for liking the video 3,positive
lets look at this from a consumer point of view paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing no big deal thats just how the business is obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console but for sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially bribe multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay full price on there platform instead because they know they cant compete with it is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get and they have the nerve to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry  talk about the pot calling the kettle black  sony has no answer to gamepass there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they cant go anywhere else this is simply sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from cod but i guarantee if sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldnt leave cod multiplatform its apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for sony  hypocrisy at its best,negative
pretty scummy on sonys part on this one the game wars are always fair game tactics until you do practices that deliberately sabotage the competition ms doesnt need the console exclusivity as game pass is on pc as well so they just want those subsriptions,negative
i understand if you pay for exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service but blocking 3rd party multi platform games is shitty,negative
i didn’t even know gamepass had more potential until i learned that they are preventing it from having a lot of games ugh it used to be ridiculous to think that dvd blue ray would stop being a thing when videos went to netflix hulu and etc but i think that’s the future of social media anyways just my opinion,negative
imo whats most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly theyre hoping to get out of these deals everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money but then what i have to wonder is if gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios then why wouldnt they turn down ps in theory gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties weve also seen plenty of evidence that xbox is swimming in microsoft money so they should easily have the means to outbid sony for games they want on their service as well as typical console exclusives for that matter yet we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to sonys deals and stipulations if a studio wanted to join gp and told sony they would decline their gp restriction contract i can see them getting less marketing on ps but i highly doubt sony wouldnt want their sales cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with sony but i dont know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line it just seems to me like somehow many studios arent jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it that or gp isnt as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think no shade at gp i love it just saying i dont get how ms would be losing out to sonys contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place,positive
its quite obvious to me that sony fears microsoft thats why they keep blocking games from going to xbox what the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play grow up sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing,negative
im huge xbox fan but honestly there has been barely anything outside 3rd party mostly been playing old games but next 2 years from this point has huge potential i want to see avowed already my most anticipated xbox game also forza motorsport will be first next gen experience on xbox i belive,positive
my favorite xbox series accessorie is the pdp media remote ive had it for about 6 months and its great especially for the price got it for 10 on sale on amazon and they are i think 20 or 25 now worth every penny unlike the series 2 i bought its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones however the price is still to much if your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for 150 if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished,positive
ive had an xbox 360 for 8 yrs it just recently started overheating it still works but i went straight for the series x all access is 3708 a month for 2 yrs for the console a controller and a 2 yr game pass ultimate subscription ive been running it off my hotspot works great console and cloud gaming thank god my internet will be fixed this week,positive
i really wish they would beef up the storage on the s for its current price a 1tb xbox x is the same price as an s with a 1tb expansion makes it way less appealing granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the s overall i feel if it wasnt for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture as it stands theres not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel hopefully production ramps up for ps and xbox so we can leave last gen behind,negative
i would say that the best thing about the xbox2 aka series sx are the memory cards theyre convenient swappable with the size that aaa even some aa games are coming at these days i view them as essential with the ps5 id have to get at a bare minimum a 2 tb which isnt swappable,positive
if we could just get support for older games to run at higher frame rates and resolutions that would be amazing,positive
its pretty ridiculous that microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now neither company should be focused on pro consoles until the series x and ps5 have been out and have reached their full potential,negative
i just bought my first xbox system 3 weeks ago series s and their game pass is awesome ive already tried about 15 games and found some games i would have never tried such as as dusk falls which i enjoyed,positive
literally just bought my series x two days ago and it arrives later this day im genuinely so excited as this seems to be with all the acquisitions and new games being added its going to be the decade of the xbox heres to hoping for a bright future,positive
cant wait to see an xbox at best buy target or walmart ah the old days,positive
i feel you on the cost of the pro series controller i have one of the series 1 pro controllers which i bought used and frankly i was disappointed that after i had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel i had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there because xbox doesnt offer their own replacement parts which i find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue to be honest i would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isnt going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time the paddles are nice and all but i can buy like 3 games for the cost or i can buy a third party controller from scrub for less and get the same functionality out of it but hey to each their own what i would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab i would pay extra for that but as it stands right now ill stick with my standard series x controller ,negative
if an elite series 3 controller is on the horizon microsoft really needs to focus on quality control i went through 3 series 2 controllers before giving up and getting a refund i experienced faulty paddles loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks i really wanted to love it but i couldnt warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues,negative
family plan sounds great miss the old version we had on 360 considering ive bought at least 4 consoles per generation and 4 subscriptions monthly isnt exactly cheap this is possibly the biggest news of this gen for myself,positive
matthew first of all you done a great job with your videos love them all have you seen the recent job offers by bioware the next dragon age seem in a big trouble and i think it will be great to know your opinion best regards from catalonia,positive
this game should work 140 better based on graphics showcase devs nowadays are a joke with optimisations lol,positive
love how you show between both series x and s side by side,positive

which game are you most excited for this month september or even october what games are you hoping to see announced,positive
great games to look forward to in the next couple months i really wish there were more coop options,positive
ever since ubi started putting games on game pass immortals is the game ive wanted them to drop there i like the art style over the ultra realistic and the mythology based storyline should be perfect for a classic action adventure experience,positive
bruh xbox is literally kicking sonys butt with the game pass and i’m loving it ,positive
plague requiem high on life and moon scars are the ones i’m soo hyped for i love gamepass lets go,positive
edith finch is leaving wow that game has been on gamepass since up first launched if im not mistaken i had just figured it would be a permanent title great game if you like story and want something you can beat fairly quickly for achievements,positive
out of all of these the only one im looking forward too is high on life looks like ill be starting my second play through of kingdom come deliverance and if you havent played it yet and love big open world story driven rpgs with basic survival mechanics and quite different combat mechanics i highly suggest it though its still got a few bugs,positive
a plague tale requiem moonscars high on life also dont sleep on immortals it is a fantastic game and even though im 37 years old dreamlight valley looks great too,positive
great content keep it up,positive
shame elite is going away just invested about 8 hours this week got up to a t9 hauler decked out with a tier fsd just wary about throwing any money at the devs after they pulled the rug out from under console players discontinuing console development,negative
quick resume is a game changer i found myself completely flipping my gaming habits jumping between several games in one gaming session awesome,positive
its like a superpower the way linus delivers entertaining and informative commentary so naturally,positive
this doesnt have ray tracing or anything like that but the realism from the sun on the screen from my blinds priceless,positive
love my series x i also love my one x too i honestly didn’t think that there would be much difference boy how wrong i was loadingdownloading times are insane and quick resume is freaking incredible so thankful for that bad boy,positive
the one x is still a very relevant console as it does native 4k on many games even if it is a stable 30fps and even some at 60fps mostly ms titles digital foundry even said graphical differences are very miniscule and for the most part it would take a magnifying glass to spot the differences which is true since ive compared both side by side when they get must have next gen titles only itll probably be worth it as of now the one xand pro are just fine on a 4k display,positive
hearing linus say its better than a pc in any way you know its an amazing machine,positive
i own a series s bought it when the x was impossible to find last year and honestly it runs great yet to see how next gen gaming truly performs on this thing but i havent had a single issue with the machine load times are waaayy faster than the xbox one s and ps4 looks great on my 1440p monitor and when upscaling on 4k tvs gamepass is great the hard drive is a bit small for holding sx optimized games i use an external for everything else stick to performance mode and you will not have any frame rate issues lastly it fits in my backpack if i travel with it this thing is worth every penny imo,positive
more like a 510 performance boost which will allow to push the console just a lil more which could make a world of difference for the series s,positive
more ram being allocated to game devs is nice but it doesn’t solve one of the biggest issues of the series s which is the bandwidth of the memory itself also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see lod culling it isn’t going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60 but it might allow a stuttering inconsistent 30 fps to hold a more locked 30 fps,negative
i hope they continue to get more put of it in the future as well we need to finally leave last gen development behind and focus on the series s as the base for optimization going forward its the perfect 1440p console and it pairs perfectly with 1440p monitors at the moment due to 1440p scaling at launch and a decent internal upscale for older content when displayed on a 1440p monitor you cant touch the value at this price point,positive
sony did the same with the ps3 cell processor back in the day the uncharted sequels looked better than the first one because developers were granted access to higher memory,positive
im loving my series s and this is great to hear cant wait to see how far these features along with the rdna2 ones will carry it,positive
this is so awesome i travel a ton so i take my series s with me because i wouldnt need to take several cds but i have a small rotation of games im able to play i love this so much,positive
im really excited for hogwarts legacy as that looks like it could be something both fantastic and fresh,positive
no love for pragmata i’m really looking forward to see more of that game specially some gameplay since the concept of the only trailer we have is so trippy i’m personally looking forward for some stalker 2 atomic heart and pragmata,positive
man ryan takes forever to get to the point,negative
i’m really hoping for some stalker 2 news,positive
hoping sony will announce that the ps5 will be back in stock,positive
finally its you guys been waiting for you all the week ,positive
ps been dropping at least one exclusive every year since launch so far i’m hoping to just hear something about these xbox titles avowed everwild fable indiana jones perfect dark contraband wolfenstien 3 the evil within 3 can’t wait to finally see something from these,positive
i’m a little disappointed that calisto protocol is gonna be crossgen it’s understandable because it’s been in development for a while,negative
what i learned from this episode 1943 was a very important year in mcu history,positive
were definitely seeing blonsky or wong for sure in the next episode im so excited,positive
i love this show marvel is on a roll this is a relatively new character as far as i know im glad that there isnt too much comedy so far i prefer comedy that is organic in a show like this i will definitely continue watching,positive
the way she says attorney at law reminds me a lot of allison from orphan black ,positive
i’m so excited for the next episode,positive
i wish my family could talk like this over family dinner discussing mcu theories would be a dream come true ,positive
imagine a potluck between all the mcu superheroes families the kvetching would be epic,positive
legit tho i’m happy someone asked about hawkeye it’s just amazing just incredible,positive
i just love tatiana’s expressions in this man family dinners,positive
right seeing family dynamics in the mcus a breath of fresh air since ms marvel and family dinners can be a hit or miss the artwork shown in the pilot really gave us an idea on how episode 2 will play out tatiana maslanys nailing it as shehulkjennifer walters,positive
this is where the show really shines just let tat play her character shes a joy to watch so fun,positive
what a mood  tatiana’s expressions during the conversations,positive
“does he pick them up when he’s done” that’a actually a pretty good question,positive
hey guys if you want to help me win an insane show in hollywood you can vote for free daily here,positive
hope to hear about f4 casting they’re going to need the two years they have to complete the cast and complete the writing then shoot then reshoot as they do and then get a teaser out months before the release of the film heck they announced captain marvel and brie larsen over two years in advance,positive
we all knew marvel was going to save the good announcements for disney day and d23 cant wait,positive
much in the way they did with spiderman it does help to have fantastic four cast early so they can introduce them in other movies and shows that allows them to introduce the characters and have their audience familiar with them without having to do another origin story for them,positive
we are just so blessed to be living in a time where there’s so much marvel content… i’m a huge fan man been watching for a while now i’m very grateful for the shows movies everything the mcu has brought us thanks for keeping us in the loop as always you’re the ,positive
ff needs an announcement to slowly big that hype with actors and directors for sure thunderbolts is on schedule as much speculation on members and who will be the villains will be i do like the idea of the squadron supreme sinister from another universe as mention in mr romans previous posts,positive
im stoked for f4 casting and while yes its 2 years away it was also announced in 2019 so theyve had 3 years to cast it and im willing to bet they had it cast before watts left the project and they may have them cast early so they can pop up in another film before their solo outing it would make sense for them to show up in quantumania,positive
sounds like a pretty solid lineup i cant imagine them not doing the werewolf by night or guardians holiday special some what but i guess well see,positive
super pumped to see who is coming in f4 full steam ahead with everything thats coming in the thunderbolts kang dynasty secret wars and so much more in the mcu,positive
this is a trailer done correctly not spoiling anything yet still pulling our emotions angela basset is phenomenal and her line got me right in the feels,positive
this movie will be epic definitely break every marvel record when it drops love the cast soundtrack outfits makeup etc wakanda 4eva rip chadwick ,positive
i got goosebumps after listening to this trailer this trailer is really good and full of emotions “i am queen of the most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone have i not given everything” that line and the trailer as a whole sent chills down my spine can’t wait to see this,positive
the fact that they included chadwicks death in the story and made it a core part of the drama is a great way for the writers to connect the audience with the movie we all grief chadwick and we are going to see how other people deal with this grief hope the move is as majestic as the music from the trailer,positive
this is not just a teaser its a heartfelt tribute to chadwick boseman,positive
chadwick boseman is the reason were where we are with this sequel you rest in peace my friend you are and always will be our black panther wakanda forever this trailer looks epic,positive
this trailer is so powerful if the trailer can bring you to tears just imagine what the movie will do rip chadwick boseman,positive
this is potentially going to be one of the greatest movies that marvel has put forth this trailer speaks volume and the fact that they did not reveal much is even more fantastic dolby amc opening night i have my eye on you,positive
since day one when this trailer came out i cannot stop watching absolutely phenomenal,positive
honestly i had doubts about this movie and if it should even be made but this trailer changed my mind it’s so powerful and this is now one of my most anticipated marvel movies definitely one of marvels best trailers ever the music the cinematography and emotion incredible,positive
as a woman i love this video something felt so off this phase i couldn’t put my finger on it and you explained it perfectly its so insulting for both sexes that what they’re doing is saying that men have to be so stupid and useless in order for women to be strong and smart,negative
the thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas i love seeing diversity it’s a wonderful thing but it shouldn’t come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation just write good stories and good characters it’s remarkably simple,negative
it’s always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk the cgi looks terrible the marvel humor is painfully unfunny and i’m getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes i’m not watching it simply because it has women in it you hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation nobody cares about the character’s identity people only get annoyed when the actors directors and studios start sucking themselves off and act like they’re mlkj’s successor it’s also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product same thing with their messages sure there are some good messages like choosing love and don’t be racist but they do a terrible job of conveying them also i don’t think a corporation that’s constantly getting accused of discriminating against race religion gender ethnicity panders to intolerant international consumers has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them does business with oppressive governments and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance,negative
i’m a huge marvel fan… can’t wait to see each project this was wonderfully done and beautifully narrated i was hoping other people were feeling this too… it’s bizarre,positive
as an asian who was actually born and brought up in asia i had never felt issues watching western shows and their flawed representation i mean if i want to watch a local movie i would just watch one from my own country as there is no way americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves this is until i am being lectured about how representation works and how happy i should be watching americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them i mean seriously you are telling me your representation of chinese is representing all the worlds chinese that is patronizing as hell because i can tell you there are so many differences between american chinese china chinese and other chinese living in different parts of the world crazy rich asians just made me cringe so hard yes i am from singapore i believe no way home would be the last good mcu movie for a long time ever if not forever tried to watch dr strange 2 but felt like they killed the original dr strange and replaced him with a fake if you want a good representation movie in recent times try everything everywhere all at once great representative movie not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life i mean they even represented rocks who else can top it,negative
when end game was on the horizon i remember being legitimately scared that the writers would make captain marvel kill thanos and single handedly stop his army so thankful they still knew how to write satisfying character arcs for the finale of my favorite franchise the mcu ended with endgame and everything since has just been put on the sacrificial alter of phase 4 feminism though spider man nwh was just a oneoff great movie for me since tobey’s spidey was the first movie i remember seeing in theaters,positive
it sucks how they’ve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters  spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly like you said these new characters lack any character growth and as such i don’t feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable i just don’t care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters also i just discovered your channel and i love your content ,negative
im so happy to see the live action version of princess fiona disappointed they left out shrekbut hulk is a good compromise,positive
im infinitely better at controlling my anger than you bruce abused as a child loses women he loves including nat chased by the military his entire life and forced into hiding lives in fear of transforming and murdering innocents actually attempts suicide jennifer sometimes i get catcalled,negative
my favourite part was when shehulk said dont call me shehulk its shulk truly the most tv series of our time,positive
daredevil at the end was the icing on the cake show looks like it’s going to be awesome,positive
do your thing i really like this outfit shehulks clothes were fully intact what was the purpose of that line,positive
“evil cannot create anything new they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made”,negative
“i control my anger infinitely more than a repressed man who was abused as a child chased by military and had his entire life love and career ruined by an accident that produced a giant rage monster” well done writers,negative

crazy how daredevil is getting the same hype as secret wars shows how much the fans love him,positive
unbelievable as a comic book fan i still cannot believe how far marvel has come along thank you marvel and disney,positive
these announcements are bigger than the “infinity saga” as a whole secret wars is the singular biggest event in comics and with this kang storyline being set up these next two phases will easily be the best yet i am incredibly excited to behold what the “multiverse saga” will bring,positive
im one of those fans that get excited when watching any marvel movie or series i love what disney and marvel studios have created i cant wait to watch all of these,positive
i feel so lucky to be here to witness the birth of not only a new phase but a new saga too i got into marvel during phase 4 and missed out on all of the infinity saga hype and seeing all of this for phase 5 makes me feel so so happy especially with all the joy marvel has bought me currently i am literally so ready to witness these movies and shows with others and cannot wait to see what comes in the mcu,positive
i have to say that i couldnt be more pleased to hear the daredevil is going to get a long episodic run 18 episodes is literally awesome that is probably my favorite news out of this whole slate release,positive

appreciate that they went for funny and wacky situations to put a hulk in rather than pushing the message that shes a strong female character gives me slight amounts of hope,positive
looks like everyone had a blast making this show that gives me hope because this is supposed to be a really fun show,positive
okay 104 actually made me laugh and smile i’m excited for this show and right now it’s the only reason i haven’t cancelled my disney,positive
i actually really enjoyed this trailer probably the best out of the previous she hulk trailers there are a few things im worried about with this show but it definitely has lots of potential,positive
i love how wong is starting to pop up everywhere hes really taking the sorcerer supreme job seriously and im along for the ride i was gonna say he deserves his own show which he totally does but then i thought at this point the entire mcu is his show the way he shows up in everything ,positive
im looking forward to this and because tatiana maslany is so talented her 4th wall interaction reminds me of her characters from orphan black ill bet thisll be funny d,positive
i love how wong is starting to pop up everywhere hes really taking the sorcerer supreme job seriously and im along for the ride i was gonna say he deserves his own show which he totally does but then i thought at this point the entire mcu is his show the way he shows up in everything,positive
you know wong is the most underpaid actor in mcu because they put him in everything,negative
looking forward to this tatiana maslany looks incredible in the role ,positive
na minha cultura a morte não é o fim,positive
lágrimas nesse trailer e principalmente na imagem do chadwick ,negative
esse trailer foi de arrepiar tá lindo demais espero do fundo do meu coração que esse filme não decepcione ,positive
cara que trailer lindoque trilha fantástica que seja uma grande homenagem a chadwick ele merece,positive
i will say the cgi is looking a whole lot better actually made the show feel more interesting props to the teams working on it,positive
this looks really good and im talking about the relationship dynamic between bruce and jennifer as well as the vfx the music goes well too,positive
wow that video was amazing the show looks so fun im glad they fixed the cgi so that the characters look like theyre actually enjoying themselves i saved almost 90 on my airfare purchases using mighty  travels  premium,positive
love shehulk seeing her in court should be hilarious but im itching to see how well shes going to break the 4th wall really hope she points some healthy fun at the marvel cinematic universe,positive
ok honestly the cgi on she hulk looks better than in the teaser that last shot of her saying “that’s good” looks real something she never did before,positive
she hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics i read as a kid decent action but mostly hilarious if this is a half as funny theyll have a winner,positive
i absolutely love the cousin rivalry these two have bruces little punk and jens teasing makes me incredibly excited for this bruce has been a comfort character of mine for a while and i cant wait to see him some more with the addition of a new hero i will say bruce seems unbelievably upbeat through everything hes been though from his childhood to the end of the infinity saga but im glad to see him less awkward and more confident in himself i understand this is about introducing jennifer to the mcu but if we dont get a little of bruces backstory perhaps provoked by jen making a remark about childhood stuff i will riot j,positive
i love that bruce is learning to cut loose and and not stuck in his stickinthemud ways anymore that trip to sakaar certainly did wonders to his selfesteem,positive
estoy muy contento de que daredevil de charlie cox esté recibiendo más amor cada vez porque su serie fue increíble además de hacer un cameo en spiderman no way home que fue genial daredevil es uno de mis superhéroes terrestres favoritos de marvel gran trailer,positive
la escena final del tráiler me dio un feeling a la escena final del tráiler de civil war donde aparece spiderman por la maroma de ambos héroes sin duda se vienen grandes cosas para daredevil ,positive
que genial volver a ver a daredevil ahora tengo más hype por la serie,positive
dont know about the weird glowing power change but kamala as herself is on point with her personality,positive
i can’t believe i actually enjoyed this show i mean i kinda had low expectations but it surprisingly was really good and the characters were quite fun to watch so this show really great and quite fun to watch so i’ll give it a 810,positive
just finished watching it today and i absolutely loved it  i love how they included culture in it i love the humourous scenes and the story telling of kamalas ancestors very fun and refreshing to watch cant wait to see her again in future mcu projects,positive
that show was actually so good i wasnt expecting much but i ended up loving it kamala character is amazing 3,positive
i watched it atleast 8 to 10 times literally it was fantastic hats off to iman vellani and marvel,positive
i loved this comic when i was younger i cant believe theyre actually making a series super exited and hope she gets the same powers she has usually later on 3,positive
i hah watched all the eps and its really great i loved all the plottwists and everything i really reccamend to watch it,positive
absolutely fantastic graphics visuals effects and most the traditional vibe indian songsunique love from indian,positive
absolutely diserves blinding lights ever i imagined ms marvel would be introduced like this and she is awesome as and the theme is awesome too its made for u ms marvel to born in mcu,positive
simplesmente demais ,positive

spidermans is assemble ,positive
esse trailer e acredito que o filme também é uma grande e linda homenagem ao chadwick boseman que infelizmente nos deixou tão cedo que descanse em paz nosso rei ,positive
todos nós sabemos que ele sempre será eterno ,positive
i ended up loving this trailer more than the movie ,positive
thor’s lost his brother sister mother father friends warriors three the avengers girlfriend mjolnir home people yet he’s still standing he’s a true source of inspiration that’s why i look up to thor,positive
i love the intro to this trailer so much it’s only 20 seconds but you think about thors entire journey in those 20 seconds and how far he has come brings me to tears everytime,positive
when they trailer gives you a better feeling than the movie,positive
i still feel kinda bad for thor he lost everything because of thanos hela and malekith his brother mother father and brother friend are all dead,negative
just compare this version of thor from the thor in the very first thor movie truly eye opening how much development he’s had as a character,positive
this trailer felt so promising cant believe how daft the actual movie is by comparison,negative
054 scene is exactly the same as in the original comic movie looks dope already love it,positive
i only play heros that can fly so while im not waiting for her ill use her whenif she comes out id like to see falcon though,positive
this gave me full body chills ,positive
i love how stan’s “he’s your bother” and “she’s your sister” lines were for two sets of people who were enemies but made peace with one another,positive
even after 6 months a few movies released and few changes in the slate this this still feels powerful,positive
this is why we  marvel,positive
seeing spiderman no way home after “will be worth the wait” hits different now because… it was… it really was…,positive
i bet every marvel fan has got goosebumps atleast once while watching this video,positive
wandavision the falcon and the winter soldier and loki have all been great shows definitely some of the best content the mcu has put out,positive
you know it’s good when the scenes in the movies sync with the music,positive
muito feliz em ver a continuação de shrek e sua esposa ,positive
estou adorando ver as colaborações com a marvel me surpreendeu que lu do magalu estará no filme parabéns aos envolvidos ,positive
ahh nada melhor do que ver mais um filme com esse cgi super realista ,positive
só eu imaginei essa interação funcionário 1 poderíamos fazer um modelo 3d do zero dessa personagem e manter a personalidade destrutiva dela marvel mas isso custaria muita grana principalmente para uma série então não funcionário 2 poderíamos esticar a imagem dela e botar um filtro de cor verde algo simples sem gastar nada marvel perfect ,positive
com tanto efeito verde ao mesmo tempo e com essa qualidade incrível já já aparece o dollynho com uma capa de super heroi minha série ,positive
the first trailer had me hyped this trailer has me ultra hyped,positive
i really really loved the movie i wish it had taken a more serious turn because i agree with the villain’s perspective and it would have been amazing to see him as a more developed character however the movie was hilarious and i’ve needed a good laugh i had a really good time and i think in the end that’s what matters to me,positive
the part where thor said its thunder time and thundered patrick bateman really put me to tears truly a movie,positive
i don’t know what to say about this movie it is one of the marvel movies of all time the cgi is animated the characters are written the story is written the acting is done and overall the movie is made it is a movie it’s one of the mcu movies of all time i like the part where thor said “it’s thundering time” and then he thundered all the bad guys truly a movie,positive
christian bale as gorr looks terrifying love it,negative
definitivamente supero mis espectativas muy bueno excelente,positive
gorr was amazing just upset the quote you are not like the other gods ive killed wasnt in the movie idk in the trailer it was just smooth af,positive
this is without a doubt one of the movies of this year,positive
its like watching a whole new god of thunder it doesnt feel like watching thor because hes so serious and in this he is taken to a joke,negative
dont forget wandavision it not only gave a background to their relationship but showed there was love between the two of them,positive
lets all be real aunt may and happy are the best couple,positive
scott and hope are the best couple and theyre actually realistic but dangerously underrated,positive
vision and wanda maximoff are the best mcu couple,positive
we can all agree the romanogers kiss was the best,positive
un propósito lo es todo fuiste el héroe que más perdió en su evolución gracias thor obtendrás el descanso que mereces,positive
y este bello universo que seguimos hace mas de 10 años sigue mas vivo que nunca  vamos carajo por mas del mcu,positive
en serio sweet child o mine le queda perfecto al avance love guns nroses  regresará ha estar de moda así como something in the way de nirvana en the batman ,positive
jennifer actually saying lawyer show straight into the camera is exactly what i want to see in a shehulk series,positive
i will definitely watch this show it’s different and with all the chaos that ensues in the mcu it’s nice to have a change of course there will still be chaos but not like some avengers level threat…hopefully,positive
this looks amazing they clearly are making a very entertaining show cant wait to see who else the surprise characters are that shows up,positive
this is hilarious i want the show to have this exact feel to it,positive
i honestly hope that beginning part with the dun dun is actually the intro for the whole series cause thats hilarious,positive
as a law and order franchise fan i appreciate the beginning of this clip,positive
weirdly enough this is the trailer that sold me seems like an actual breath of fresh air looking at the mcu from a new angle and if that opening joke is any indication looks like a fun show im honestly excited now,positive
i died at the “dun dun” can’t wait for this show to come out,positive
super excited going to binge it when final episode comes out ,positive
this was a great stream it felt like the production quality had gone up a lot since the last marvel one and everyone played well i thought peter was a great addition to the stream he started a little quiet but really got into it,positive
love it cant wait for this box and also the wolverine pack also cant wait to see what else you guys have in store for the xmen saga,positive
we cant wait to get the box and hero packs so we can play the campaign on the channel xmen my favorite comic franchise glad to see them come to champions,positive
great stream really love seeing the passion and enjoyment you all show for the game it’s also obvious how much you understand the core of characters and continually being that across in your designs thanks and keep up the good work,positive
great stream slims cards are subtly powerful really affected the outcome,positive
love xmen hopefully they stay around a long long time this game will now be called xmen the card game as far as i’m concerned and if it’s not too late i’d love to see quentin quire aka kid omega,positive
unfortunately i wasn’t able to make it live but i do have a question how do you resolve shadows of the past with phoenix it seems a waste to have this restrainedunrestrained status mechanic only to have sotp say just forget all that,negative
shrek 5 looks great,positive
she hulk “im better at controlling my anger because i control my anger infinitely more than you i control my anger when im catcalled in the street and when toxic men explain my job to me” do the writers even know bruce banner at all or do they just look at him as “a man that gets angry and turns green and big” because that line of dialogue was ridiculous bruce banner was abused as a kid watched his father figure beat his mom to death bruce tried to off himself and failed bruce has to live with the fact that hulk took control of his body and mass killed innocent people in avengers 2 absolute ridiculous writing,negative
she hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics i read as a kid decent action but mostly hilarious if this is half as funny theyll have a winner,positive
hulk has fought aliens monsters been sent into space been in battles taken on thanos forced into hiding had a split personality and has been hunted and attacked by the military but shehulk was sort of cat called by three guys outside a bar and her boss did some mansplaining early in the episode so her life is in her words infinitely more stressful than real hulk this show is making feminism seem more ridiculous not less also smart hulk sucks aaron american,negative
im so glad i found and watched that video i miss when movies used to make sense im expecting this series to explain why the hulk is back in his human form in shang chis end credits i saved almost 90 on my flights using mighty  travels  premium,positive
its great to see hulk jumping again,positive
love the part where she says its hulkin time truly one of the shows of the year,positive
i adore tatiana shes easily one of the best actors currently working between her brilliant performances in orphan black or in 2020s perry mason but my god this looks pretty terrible im so bummed for her because this is the first mainstream exposure shes gotten as an actor and this looks like its shaping up to be a complete trainwreck,negative
when you start telling the audience how to feel about the character see super girl e1 you have to doubt they will succeed at showing us a compelling character,negative
my favorite part was morbius is saved by shehulk in the first episode their scene celebrating in the champaign room afterward was a comedy goldmine he repays her kindness by teaching her the secret of activating full power with morbin time,positive
me meo con el momento “jessica gao”… eres el mejor tío ,positive
captain america turns chair around and sits down so…you made fun of me and suffered the consequences,negative
seeing those flamin hot cheetos go to waste was such a heart wrenching moment for me,negative
this right here is propably the most important thing to make a show or movie like that really work on an emotional level it grounds even the most fantastic characters and stories in a way no amount of vfx can casual smalltalk that actually feels like smalltalk with all the natural imperfections she even slightly misspoke like we all do from time to time 010 and they left that in that takes courage but it makes even this short clip so much better i respect that a lot and i am really looking forward to this show,positive
“oh ok so this must be some jerkwad driving like in doctor strange“ spaceship “what the hell” oo,negative
ok that got me i was not expecting that i thought it would be some kind of a regular car accident but this is the mcu i guess,negative
se siente diferente cuando ves a thor sonreír después de endgame esto va a ser un peliculón ,positive
menudo hype,positive
no se si le tengo más ganas a esta o a doctor strange 2 que pasada marvel aun después de endgame nos seguís maravillando siempre viva marvel,positive
por fin el tráiler esta película será epicaaa ,positive
so far these animated projects look super interesting i hope marvel studios continues investing more animated content in the future because there are so many different ideas and possibilities that they can do with animation that would be complicated doing in liveaction there’s should be variety imo ,positive
i am groot that beautifully poetic quote had me tearing up truly inspirational this will forever be remembered as marvel histor,positive
as much as i was excited for what if and xmen97 but now that mature rating for marvel zombies which it should is confirmed its definitely on the top of my list of series to watch when it comes it,positive
spiderman freshman year looks so promising and exciting i really wish it was mcu’s spiderman 4 ,positive
i am groot was truly a historic and cultural masterpiece it is one of the most poetic heartfelt stories ever told better than any shakespeare play truly one of the most historic things to happen this year,positive
i’m most excited for xmen ‘97 from the animated shows marvel zombies sounds cool i’m looking forward to the gore since it’s got a tvma rating,positive
these animation styles are pretty unique and beautiful cant wait to try them out,positive
i love how they made groot even more cute now back to being baby groot,positive
cant wait for all these marvel animated projects,positive
let there be zombies that’s the one i was most hype for,positive

wow,positive
luv luv luv mean bad witches okkkuuuuurrrrr,positive
i love this fameplay,positive

i love capn,positive
if there’s a marvel moment that you’re amazed didn’t make our list it’s surprisingly easy to tell us in the comments for more marvel click here,positive
no matter how old i get seeing those portals open in endgame will always put joy in my heart,positive
charlie cox’s matt murdock as a surprise cameo in ‘spiderman no way home’ is also priceless,positive
its heartbreaking how sad strange is when he says everyone who knows and loves you we we will have no memory of you,negative
the snap was awesome but finally getting to hear avengers assemble was off the chart it brought home all of the years of wait for an epic payoff thats my own number one,positive
avengers endgame itself is speechless,negative
“we can handle your little witch” proceeds to get destroyed with ease,negative
i personally love the marvel mech line and i think rocket raccoon will make for a super fun looking one ,positive
this set with morbius is gonna to be one of the lego sets ever made,positive
my favorite part is when just2good stepped on a lego morbius set and said its reviewing time,positive
i like that lego is finally making morbius as he already had a brief appearance in the daily bugle also the rocket mech set could be groot and rocket together but well have to wait to see,positive
no but i’m genuinely hyped for the morbius set  glad it’ll be cheap too,positive
if you asked me if a morbius set would sell out before the movie was announced i would say no i’m excited we’re getting him though want him to be in a set with spidey and blade,positive
i get people are meming about morbius but he is unironcally a really interesting character and i love to see how they will design his minifig design,positive
no way im in complete disbelief there is a morbius set even if it is most likely comic book based thats awesome,positive
cant believe this year kass will have a bump and next year a new addition ,positive
ledger in the background jumping was so cute to me and i have no clue why y’all fam is so pretty ,positive
yessss kass next year you will have a new baby boy or girl to dress up with your family i bet it will look so cute i hope you have a good day or night by the way i just love your costumes,positive

aww ledger on the background jumping so cute  i can’t wait for kass to have her baby bump has an addition and you guys are soo lucky the kids going to have the best aunts uncles and grandparents i also loved watching all your reactions on kass’s channel your such a cute family  sending lots of love to your family and i hope kass doesn’t feel sick x,positive
i think it would be kinda cool if like everyone had their own colour and dressed up in only their colour or you guys could do something related to the new movie zombies 3,positive
i think that some great halloween costumes for big family’s could be greece the movie star wars toy story different prisoners people from the 50s ghost busters movieboygirl or sea creatures,positive
omg kass is gonna have a bump it’s gonna be so exiting watching you go the journey of your pregnancy wishing you the best,positive
i can’t believe kass is pregnant i’m so happy for y’all,positive

kevin feige is clearly more powerful than thanos or even all the avengers combined that we can all agree on,positive
this has got to be the most emotional panel so far i wasn’t even there to watch the full thing but i teared up about 3 different times just by watching this,positive
wow tenoch’s speech in spanish hit me i’m not mexican i’m peruvian but i understood the message he sent out you can feel his excitement and that he’s incredibly honored to not only represent the mexican community but latin america as a whole i’m looking forward for namor,positive
last but definitely not least for the first time on the big screen namor the submariner i feel like most people wont really understand how historic that line from coogler is also shows he really understands the depth of the character and im so happy for it,positive
man i’m still in awe of how far marvel has come,positive
i literally lost it when the black panther artists came to perforn the cast came on stage lord mbaku lol talked about the movie each individual experience feelings of honoring this film to their late great brother chadwick  to see the trailer b4 hand watching this panel i cried this will be epic another groundbreaking movie at box offices everywhere cant wait ,positive
this is my first time watching an announcement for upcoming marvel movies lmao these upcoming projects are sick asf can’t wait to watch these i’m most excited about the avengers movies hopefully they are as good as infinity war and end game gonna miss the original 6 avengers though,positive
that emotion after they showed the wf trailer was incredible,positive
hey marvel fans check out this awesome video by our friends at cbr,positive
chadwick was a legend he will be remembered ,positive
it also helps the robert downey jr looks just like tony starks from the comic book its kinda like he was born to play the part haha,positive
chadwick did more and better while dying of cancer than most actors ever will in their entire careers he was a true gentleman in every sense of the word rest in power chadwick ,positive
rdj is an amazing man to live with a disease that nearly cost him everything and not limited to his actual life to come back and be one of the best actors and humans i’ve ever watched from afar as a fan change his entire life style ,positive
its finally here drop a like if youre hyped to see this suit in the game even if its a mod,positive
this peter’s model is so perfect for this suit it looks like it’s actually andrews peter in the suit unlike the mcu ones,positive
this is one of the best suits in spiderman history and its a welcome surprise seeing it in spiderman no way home when andrew garfield was wearing it in the movie if this suit ever makes it in spiderman remastered officially itll be just amazing seriously no pun intended ,positive
ill wait until they are fully finished  dont get me wrong the suit looks good actually but i needed that movie looking suit with that actual texture and velvety red and blue look with those ballgy glassy eyes,positive
the fact that insomniacs sound for webswinging is very similar to original tasm2 film makes it 100 more awesome,positive
that suit looks amazing this suit needs to be put on either spiderman remastered or spiderman 2,positive
oh man hearing tasm2 theme makes me want the suit even more,positive
this just gets me more excited at the thought of a tasm3 movie,positive
andrews voice in the background music was syncing with spider man in the game hilarious and perfect,positive
literally the best movie suit but i really do like tom hollands far from home suit,positive
tate after he strangles you “breathe air”,negative
the screaming when he was strangling him i literally laughed so hard ,positive
everytime i see one of these shorts i question every single thing that’s made my life lead up to this moment still love the content,positive
austin is hilarious asf and hes my favorite youtuber ever ,positive
punches him in the stomach “should’ve aimed for the head”,negative
the sound effects gets me dead more than the meme itself ,negative
its good to see that my prediction all those months ago of squirrel girl being the hard counter to thanos in this game has come true,positive
“i’m the best’,positive
so how can darkhold be good in the cosmic room room 5 dr strange should never take a turn according to the passive on the room ive seen them put in that room before but it should be like 5 on 4 if you dont bring any cosmic can you please confirm this,negative
that score for the kang dynasty and secret wars avengers movies gave me serious chills what a time to be alive,positive
25 years after blade saved marvel we finally get a reboot well deserved and long awaited for sure,positive
the hype is not the same anymore when they announced back in the day phase 23 with infinity war and endgame these two if you search the reactions are insane,negative
the avengers have always held a special place in my heart i’m glad that they’re getting 2 new movies,positive
seeing the reveal for the 2 avengers movies sent chills down my spine im absolutely stunned at what all is coming in these next 2 phases,positive
bro that was just insane i can’t wait to see all of these films shows ,positive
man i’m so glad i got to witness the mcu in my lifetime truly something special and unreal,positive
even though i wasnt there i had goosebumps hearing the audiences reaction and the suspense the screen gave us,positive
the amount of planning really deserves appreciation being a marvel fan it gives me so much happiness after seeing the avengers titles but dont get me wrong the benchmark the marvel set with infinity war and endgame really seems unmatchable,positive
cool,positive
howdy,positive
if i were that close to scarlett johansson i’d have all kinds of trouble with my lines,negative
iron man is amazing even when he’s not acting like iron man robert downey jr for the win,positive
i’d love to get paid millions to just have fun ,positive
ironman saying he loves it when pepper laughs is just the best,positive
yondu being talked walked off set was funniest by farlol,positive
008 roberts laugh always makes me smile so big,positive
thanks to keeps for sponsoring this video go to ​ ​to get 50 off your first order of keeps hair loss treatment,positive
i think her sneaky lawyer tactics werent to find out if he was a virgin it was to find out if hes still alive she said i knew it after banner referred to him in the present tense the whole virgin thing was probably a misdirect,negative
thank you for this video you’re the first person to point out that bruce has childhood trauma in his past and jen doesn’t,positive
i like how hulks lab setup is relative to his size when jen walks next to it the height of the counter is up to her shoulders,positive
i was impressed by how more often than not that it actually felt like people interacting onscreen and not cgi hulk animations the montageaction in most cgi scenes i feel use so much motion blur that theyre justwellblurry there was a bit of that here but overall its becoming more naturalistic dig it eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the need to add every frame between the movements for smoothness when there isnt much smoothness at all to eye movement they did a good job with the eyes for sure this has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video but just throwing in 2 cents,positive
what is the title of this movie why does the ending of the movie get abruptly cut before completion the audience can’t see the message resolution,negative
the movie is so lovely and now part of my collection,positive
so lovely love to see the next one,positive
im so happy lmn starting to have black movies with a sprinkling of some of the greats,positive

great acting for a low budget movie but also a great message and lessons we all need to relearn as a society,positive
what an amazing movie it teach us everything we need to know wellll done guys greetings from portugal,positive
while this movie is very low budget and not what i thought it was gona be it makes a great point ive been slowly prepping for a while and have one hell of a bugout bag and i advise everybody do the same stock up while you can cause when the shtf its too late,positive
no its not an a or even a b rate moviethe core cpl went from being a no nothing not worried about nothing to analyzing what was going on around the world at that time and starting on a journey that i think many of us have been on for awhile i will not criticize their reactions too many people right now are right where they were at the start of this movie instead they started to oopen their eyes and see what possibilitys could happen and took the first steps into prepardness im as bad as they are about knowing my neighbers ill admit that ive lived in this house 25 years and i only know and talk to 2 of my neighbersand theres like 20 familys up here withen a mile mabey more folks instead of criticizing this film analyze it and see where you stand and how you can help others,negative
good movie lots to learn to be prepared,positive
for those who think life will never get this way you best be thinking about how it very much could with all the emigrants coming in with god knows what how bad things have been bad things are going getting let this sink in your head a bit,negative

 this just made a huge part of my day finding this movie classic,positive
you coulda titled this friday after next deleted scenes and it woulda had the same if not greater effect but watching this made me understand cubes real vision for the movie and the direction he wanted it to go i see why he changed some parts but i love seeing this overall,positive
i have watched this movie 100 times and i dont remember half of these scenes  i know im not getting old now,positive
after an hour i have to say this is one of the best movies of the bank heist genre ,positive
this reminds me of when i was a lumberjack in the sahara forest i know its the sahara desert now that just shows what a good lumberjack i am,positive
no clooney but this is a good movie ,positive
izleyecegiz ,positive
they shouldnt have a cut scene after the phone ring im ready for it to amp up 36 in and im thinking of switching i like the screen composition the actors and the lack of music maybe a few more minutes edit it picks up after the flashback if the flashback was just for a second after dallas asks the pacing is actually pretty solid mack and dallas are amazing actors i love their first scene and dallas and his wife in the kitchen,positive
this comment section is a fuckn joke besides that the story was amazing i love how it all played out especially since i have committed crimes back when i was a young man nothing as extreme as this movie but enough to end up in jail ive changed my life around and i never plan on going back to breaking the law when it comes to watching movies like this man do i get a rush thank you,positive
eva looks so beautifulbut her role in this movie  is envious and jealousy she didnt want the man when he acted as blind and then when she knew that he wasnt then she wanted him her evil intentions destroyed their family,negative
this was a very sad movie everyone did and elecelent job another oscar winner indeed with all the beautiful greatest legendary actors and actresses ,positive

he always wants somebody to go with him wicked old man,negative
you hit a soft spot with ronin i think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed the acting the dense subtext the camera angles the story progresses while revealing nothing awesome,positive
penelope is actually a really great movie my roommate and i love this movie and have watched it many many times if you havent seen it you should and i have to say its a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others or if youre child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like and for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be theres a lot to learn from people of all ages watch it,positive
great recommendations list darren ronin and the car chases awesome and has a great plot silence of the lambs just a superb horror agree that anthony hopkins is on his finest day with his portrayal of hannibal lecter just received my latest universal yums from czech republic today 9232021 many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation take care ,positive
these movie reviews are always good and largely because they are honest if a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed the reviewer still tries to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc its a very democratic approach always a good job,positive
i recently watched hackers again and realized that its a really good pairing with the original tron they both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary just from opposite sides of the screen great performances from a great cast in both cases they are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after al gore opened up the internet to everyone,positive
one thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material in this case being the silence of the lambs by thomas harris the film respected and captured this incredible book the casting of jodi foster and anthony hopkins with jonathan demme directing made it a masterpiece some movies you sit and watch others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you,positive
while i generally agree with your comments about ronin the callous disregard of collateral damage shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents was a total turnoff for me they spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion,negative
i just watched post mortem on netflix last night and really liked it its from norway and has only six episodes in the series im not sure how i could describe it horror a little comedy a bit police procedural i guesssome it was just really strange and at least to me very entertaining also i watch all foreign movies with subtitles so i dont know if its dubbed or not anyway check it out,positive
im sure youve seen malevolent from 2018 with florence pogue but if you havent its just a really well acted horror flick i seem to like just about everything florence pogue is in thanks for another great list as i plan to check out primer and troll 2 both of which i never would have considered without your recommendation pls keep making as many of these lists as you can,positive

immortal classics i am now 71 and saw this classic during my teens on the big screen am still a big fan of yul brynner steve mcqueen charles bronson james coburn robert vaughn and elly wallace rest in peace my teenage heroes,positive
this movie has a special place in my heart i was with my father who was dying of aids and we watched it together the night before he died the next day i remember us enjoying it together in the evening and he slipped into a coma that night and passed away the next day every time i watch this great film i remember him,positive
the magnificent seven over time has come to describe the lead actors more than the movie and the most magnificent of the seven yul brynner impossible to match him,positive
possibly not only the greatest film ever made but the greatest story the lesson being that material possession should never take prescendence over our common humanity a dollar bill always looks as big as a bedspread what a line,positive
i saw this movie in seventies as a teenager several times they were all so larger than life heroes there can never be another magnificent seven,positive
even though the movie is a remake its one of all time greats sure some plot twists are naive and the fightingeffects dont stand to contemporary cinematography but everything else is simply brilliant starting with the original score all the way to the moral lessons the movie brings a true inspiring masterpiece,positive
i first watched this movie in a cinema in 1960s the righteousness truthfulness bravery and courage shown in the characters in the movie helped to mold my character in the later days of my youth and made me join the uniformed service to serve the public,positive
one of the greatest western movies that were ever produced mostly all of those who played out their lives on the silver screen have passed away ive seen this movie around fifty times and never tire from watching it,positive
i love this movie thank you,positive
good moviethank you for uploading itgod bless,positive

it is actually so tough to even imagine the vedha character other than vijay sethupathy but hrithik is extremely talented so hoping the best to see this vedha,positive
its true that no one can replace vijay sethupati vedha role but hrithik has also done justice to the role it will be the biggest blockbuster of 2022 ,positive
that tada dada dada da tada dada dada da gives me goosebumps  this will be blockbuster ,positive
waiting we are kerala teams we love vikram vedha tamil movie madhav sir and vijay sethuparhi sir now waiting this combination heavy team,positive

hrithik always amaze us with his acting skills,positive
but seriously guys believe me this movie is gonna be a super hit this year no comparision,positive
i completely agree with you about thirteen lives i watched it the other night and i wasnt sure i was going to make it to the end it was so intense and i felt so claustrophobic and almost panicky at times watching it unbelievably fantastic movie,positive
i wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the 40s and 50s without having to pay extra for them im a big fan of classics including the likes of cary grant kate hepburn william powell etc i used to be able to watch them on youtube but theyve pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement,negative
thirteen lives was incredible its exactly how we as human should be behaving,positive
i really liked bound it shows even if you have a small budget you can still make a really good movie 13 lives was good also i watched marathon man when i was too young to get into it or understand it i recently watched it on prime,positive
you could not have been more spot on with thirteen lives darren what an amazing film incredible thank you as always for the recommendations,positive
i always appreciate the work you put into your reviews i feel that you’re very thorough and honest in your opinion thank you for what you do jcvd is an amazing movie very hidden gem,positive
another killer list ive said it before but check out birdy for one of nicolas cages earliest movies and hector and the search for happiness both are terrific movies,positive
13 lives was an excellent movie i remember hearing the situation on the news i didnt realize how long those kids were trapped and what had to be done to get them out drowning suffocating is a fear of mine so seeing this had me on the edge of my seat anxious as fuck but it was worth it i highly recommend this movie it was so so good great even,positive
i have watched vikram vedha on youtube in hindi last year i dont think saif can beat r madhwan in acting r madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie but saif doesnt look innocent at all throughout the trailer r madhwans smile was enough to make vikram vedha a thriller movie,positive
vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor i have seen in south industry n r madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece,positive
krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster ,positive
sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,negative

847 i mean i like how theyre going into the nuance of black adam the antiheroes in the dc and marvel universes are as numerous as the heroes and villains,positive

a writers odyssey is very original and entertaining it has flaws but its wildly imaginative fantasy scifi pure action epic its hard to say what genre it belongs to but its certainly not the usual hollywood remake or evil a marvel creation i saw it and was pretty impressed i can actually see hollywood doing a remake on it because its story is so original and amazing,positive

one of the better “expert rates” videos i’ve seen as a former tanker it’s cool seeing tanks getting some attention,positive
love this guy roofs are not usually designed to hold 40 ton tanks this implies that there are roofs designed to hold tanks,positive
one of the best expert videos ive seen this guy is not just very knowledgeable but also a very good communicator and even an entertaining and enjoyable person i can easily imagine this guy being loved at his job,positive
i am a member of the german army reconnaissance forces which use the spähwagen fennek and we sometimes actually call our car the batmobile also we still very much work with auftragstaktik most likely more than any army in the world,positive
unexpected chieftain is the best chieftain great guy great channel great knowledge so glad to see him on this episode,positive
this was immensely enjoyable we need more with loremaster moran,positive
the main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making although independent thinking was encouraged in the german army the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf the tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving he also has the ability to kill all of those shermans through their front armour at that range and can’t even be sure they know his exact position essentially the commander is a tool,negative
in fury it infuriated me that the german tank decided to blow his cover and close the distance with the shermans the tiger had an amazing advantage but blew it all away,negative
im trying so hard not to get too upset with most of these kids and their complete disrespect for some of these masterpieces at first glance because i know every generation goes through this stage its like an infuriating rite of passage,negative
janelle and lucas made this video an awful watch their attitude to something they’ve never seen before is unbearable,negative
the disrespect these kids had for pagemaster and the iron giant is crazy smh,negative
balto is a legend his statue in central park proves it he raced the entire length of the last two stops on the modern ididorod without help to get medication for a pandemic that hit alaska he ran in a blizzard for 8 hours without rest just to give kids children a chance to survive a true legend,positive
it’s not so much the fact that they don’t know these movies that makes me mad it’s the disrespect they are showing towards the animation that gets me mad people worked hard to draw those films hand drawn animation and cell animation was tough compared to now with computer drawn animation and a lot of the animation on these movies still hold up,negative
as always jaxon and anthony are so funny together by just being competitive jayka and danny have good chemistry too one of the reactors though was too snobbish against these classics wait till you become older and realize that some shows this decade would be considered cringe in the future too,positive
i get not knowing these movies if you literally never heard of them i get not liking the quality but janelle and lucas’ entire personality throughout this video is “let’s trash everything we see and devalue every credible thing about it” “but theyre teens” no the other teens in this video were great and open minded other teens in real life are very open minded as well these two don’t pass the vibe and i wouldn’t want to watch anything old with them,negative
i’m gen z and this is just embarrassing i knew every single one of these,negative
great seeing so many old friends in thai movie that is getting international notice good luck pee thepp and all the other guys involved mr john tahmaan,positive
great video as an established data scientist myself this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle however i almost never go through all of these steps in the same day you can spend whole days just cleaning data tuning models or putting things into production the work that you do can also vary by company some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization i have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested,positive
it was a great overview of all the process it would be great if we get more videos on data preparation eda various methods for different scenarios,positive
great video you did great explaining this that said i would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps specifically data acquisition and cleaning mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research furthermore it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found do some field work say nsf or an ffrdc gives you 2 million dollars for it go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back oh well this seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies all the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned the first two steps acquisition and cleaning are so important,positive
thank you for this super interesting video i would like to ask you something which are the most important skills that a data analyst should havelearn,positive
a nice capture of the top level elements thank you it easily gets convoluted and i was looking reflect on a simple overview,positive
simplilearn you are amazing thanks for teaching us a big chunk of knowledge within a couple of minutes now im much interested to become data scientist,positive
data science explained in such a clean and brilliant manner thank you for the awesome video,positive
this is really a very clear presentation of what really goes with a data science project from the very beginning however things do not happen very easily there are a lot of challenges that you have to deal with in data cleaning alone the time that you use can be overwhelming,negative
your videos are what is getting me the necessary introduction to data science thank you so much,positive
thank you nicely explained where does adaptive analytics stand which doesnt require historical data,positive
it was so good  will you do a video on machine learning product and machine learning in production environment at last machine learning engineering and mlops,positive
it was a perfect explanation thank you,positive
a complete explanation with good details thanks ,positive
please make another more videos on machine learning also,positive
i would be interested in a video on data science machine learning,positive
it was good explanationthank you,positive
thanks a lot,positive

i love her teaching styleim gonna finish this in 2 days its so good and easy to learnwasted 6 months in college learning this and they taught in much detail in 10 hours its amazing,positive
the course was great i liked this could u please also make python full course but not beginner level but with a life examples would be so appreciative of that ,positive
first of all thank u so much edureka for helping me out in my studies it was such an amazing video  secondly want to know why u dont have any link to the power point of the lecture personally its very difficult for me to write down everything and make notes could u plz share the ppp as well ,positive
2 hours continuously watching it and hopefully going to complete in 12 days only already in love with it  very intuitive teaching thanks for providing this knowledge for free,positive
amo esses cursos vocês são awesome muito obrigada greetings from brazil,positive
thank you edureka for this wonderful course from where can we get the datasets used in this course it would be great if you could share them through a link,positive
this is my first time in data science ive listened to thousands of lectures in my life barton poulson explains it very well in a very understandable and motivating way thank you very much to him i recommend to those who want to take this course,positive
i am only 2 hours in but i love the way you demystify what i once thought was so out of my leagueability and perhaps interest as well thank you so much,positive
21219 so far and cannot imagine how much effort these guys have put to make this this is really a beautiful attempt this is great thank you fcc,positive
i have gone through the whole video and am really grateful for the time youve invested in this the vivid pictures and friendly speaking pace were truly refreshing and helped balance the ubiquity of the text cheers from abidjan,positive
for me as a layman this is the best introduction in the topic ive found so far a video that i can always come back to and rely back on for a solid foundation,positive
barely 10 minutes in and can already appreciate the time and consideration put into this video thanks so much,positive
great course content is informative well structured and explained clearly it is evident that barton poulson is very knowledgeable and his personality really shows through his spirit is encouraging and i thoroughly enjoyed his humour keep up the inspiring work,positive
this is excellent even for people already working in related fields because it talks about many tools and concepts they may have overlooked the organization clarity and paulsons breadth of knowledge are impressive,positive
10541 so far its the best and most clearly explained video on data science ive watched so far awesome job,positive
as a current college student i really appreciate the breakdown of the different roles and responsibilities for data science keep up the good work and i would love to learn more about ds,positive
these are what i watch when im depressed about my career at 1am,negative
i wish i saw this 6 months ago ive been trying to transition careers from physics to data science and after not having much luck despite what i thought to be very similar methods used in my former career now its becoming clear why my resume is getting nowhere ive focused on the top too much havent showcased my whole pyramid thank you bro,negative
“what tools do you use we don’t care” most relevant comment i’ve seen on a data science video great video,positive
im a college student wanting to explore this field youre been a great help id love to watch ur videos on the breakdown of the buzzwordsml ai deep learning neural networks etc btw loved the video,positive
ive been interested in the term data science and what it could mean for me my hobbies and career and your video has been a brilliant introduction thank you,positive
such a concise easy to understand and thorough explanation youve got there it can be understood clearly by someone like me with no prior knowledge of what data science is and what it entails great content,positive
hey everyone this is max from the course thanks so much for checking it out weve got a ton of free resources over on the blog and my website at codingwithmaxcom to help those of you who are curious or want to learn more i hope this minicourse gives you a good basic insight into what the term data science exactly entails and i also hope it piques the curiosity in some of you to look into a career in data science if you want to dive right into it my full data scientist in 10 weeks course can be found here if you have any questions please dont hesitate to let me know ill definitely hang around here and check for any questions or comments,positive
awesome video thanks for putting in the effort to make this its funny i was totally uninterested in anything to do with math or statistics while i was in school but now i think this stuff is really cool being able to use data to learn from the past and guide your actions in the futurewhats not to like,positive
awesome breakdown on this topic max i have my roots in physics as well and went into itconsulting a few years ago i have been looking for good introductions on this topic for me it was so much easier to follow the explanations coming from a physicist thanks for that,positive
amazing amazing job nice touch with the stock photography which looks to be original learned a lot from this one keep it up,positive
this introduction is really clear thank you max for your hard work well done,positive
hi max this is great stuff for any beginner in data science do you have any videostips on probability and logistic regression that are easy to understand as well thanks,positive
hi max very informative and interesting question at 1316 you talk about continuous data and contrast every number from infinity to infinity ie numerical infinity with every number between 0 and 1 however can those numbers be equally infinite as subdivisions can be infinite,positive
thank you so much for this im going to college in the fall to major in public health and i was thinking of picking up a data science minor as well this is simple enough for me to understand what the field is what it requires,positive
thanks for all the great work you folks do,positive
damn a data scientist is just someone who is really good at a lot of hard things,positive
ive considered data science but for me itll come down to who wants to use the data and how a lot of businesses want to use data science to increase profits but im more interested in using data to discover things help people etc,positive
as someone who transferred from data science to data analysis i agree with every point here being in the everlasting learning process was particularly exhausting not that data analysis needs no learning but the intensity ds requires is of another level,negative
ive been considering taking a master degree in data science and business analytics and i was wondering whats like being a data scientist until i found your video thanks youtube and thanks tina i have more idea now,positive
this got me so excited to be a data scientist always learning in different fields and getting to continue being a scientist it sounds great,positive
the video we have been waiting on from tina ,positive
1 learn the fundamentals of maths 2 basic knowledge of computers 21 learn the basics of a programming language eg r or python 3 the most important thing learn statistics its by far the biggest part of data science machine learning is 80 statistics 4 build little projects and try to connect something with a database 5 dont be overhelmed of all that new technology stuff nobobdy knows everything and you dont need everything too,positive
im in cyber security doing vulnerability management but this is making me want to get deeper into data science i wish youtube had more entertaining and enthusiastic creators like tina ken luke in the cybersecurity field,positive
those are valuable pieces of advice i always get caught going deep but my main problem is distraction i end up learning too many things,negative
this is was far more comprehensive than i expected so many other channels will throw up python and sql and will then recommend a bootcamp or moocs solid video and thank you very much,positive
very well thought i agree with everything that has been said in the video i used the breadthfirst approach when i changed my career to software engineering couple years ago and yes its least painful and most effective way to learn skills for a technical industries thanks for the video im just starting with data science and this is very helpful not that you only say what to learn but also how and where  ,positive
this was really insightful and helpful thanks for making this,positive
i’m currently an entry level community manager data science is so intriguing to me as it would allow me to listen to userbases and other communities so much more closely you just gave me what i need to get started learning thank you,positive
i found this video to be very well done when i begin work on a new model i always start with a google search and go from there unfortunately you cant do this during an interview i feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked all the time just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper and build out a model ive been in the data science world for the past 10 years and thats 10 years of proven success if thats not good enough for you writing code on a blank sheet of paper wont help very much at all,positive
this is very helpful thanks for putting this together,positive
the biggest problem i’ve had so far is working with my manager we both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesn’t even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right we are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in 2003 so he’s an old head and i recently graduated it’s very tough to get along and having your voice heard,negative
im learning data science and whenever i read job descriptions for entry levels or even for interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have 23 years of experience plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services i mean it feels like theyre demanding an intermediate data scientist and terming it as data analysis intern or junior data analyst role this frustrates me a lot,negative
i feel like tech jobs always morph we have hiring expansions and more specialities then we have layoffs and more generalizations it does seem like the demand for data scientists dropped off a cliff but i’ve been studying it a bit as a way to complement other skills thanks for the video ,positive
its really difficult to work as a data scientist because every company have different expections from data scientist and now a days a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision deep learning operational research machine learning sql and many more there must a discrete line between data scientist work roles and also as you have mentioned interview prep it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch — struggle of a datascientist,negative
amazing your way of explaining is superb thank you so much,positive
i would like to have a video of how to start studying for data science i mean where to start and how to progress that would be helpful for those who dont know where and how to approach data science course congrats to the team thank you,positive
very well curated,positive
i dont think id ever heard of this thanks for explaining,positive
365 data science a best place to learn data science and todays content was super the concept of learning things in 5mins says how this website have depth knowledge of data science i always love 365 data science website ,positive
amazing please explain how data science will be useful in health care,positive
very well explained can use this video in a interview,positive
way of exlaination is superb,positive
great video shane completely nailed it as a data scientist myself i was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were on the job a lot of my peers find that they arent challenged enough by their positions this is probably because data science is still relatively new and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams the other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they arent liking the position at hand i love seeing the data and trying to map it to what im hearing anecdotally,positive
i loved the remark about how ifwhen data scientists jobs get automated either the world would have ended or world peace would have been achieved ,positive
excellent datadriven assessment of this field i am 57 with a bs in math just retired not really want to work in data science and pursuing a masters in statistics i have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens i was able to start on zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although i keep fit and positive i never lied about my age that would be creepy but didnt need to advertise it either so long as i pulled my weight in study groups i feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best i can you mentioned ageism and while i have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet i have experienced ageism and how ones value can diminish at a job the brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating me ill keep on going until i cannot i enjoy turning data into knowledge i am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos either way keep the data and its interpretation flowing and rage rage against the dying of the light,positive
i’m a data analyst i will say you need to be good at attention to detail and actually know your skill set one wrong variable can skew your results majorly which can cost time and money i’ve had to bite the bullet before and it hurts wasting hours of your life on something that needs to be redone or straight abandoned,negative
thanks for the great content shane as a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing i have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route if you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot while traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth you end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge coming from an engineering discipline myself i was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways i have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route i say this because i have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through they definitely can break through and thrive in this field they offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route so if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as nlp if you are someone who comes from a stem field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems all data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science but what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model i dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but i do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,positive
great video im a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position so i have some ideas on the markets for both jobs in my opinion the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed those folks oftentimes wont even get past the hr screener theres so many new data science and analytics masters programs that have opened up along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable statistics computer science economics physics etc that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview even if you have a great portfolio the hr screen is not even going to look at it however if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics masters degrees the job market becomes super easy,positive
hi shane the actuary here who has commented on your channel frequently i would just like to point out that actuary is a special case of data scientist the skill sets are extremely similar and also there are many data scientists who are hired by insurance companies i havent finished watching your video yet but i already know this is a really good one whether in or out of insurance,positive
shane i would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information i looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science usually people will go into something like business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs for instance in it career questions even though it may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of 1520 an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin,positive
thanks alex for all the advice i finally landed a job as a data analyst at a tech startup if anyones interested i made 143 applications had 7 interviews and got 3 offers the process from starting the google course to landing a job took just under 3 months i was unemployed and working on this full time hope that helps anyone whos looking for their next job,positive
dear alex in 2 or 3 years from now i will look back at what i have achieved and i am pretty sure your channel will be one of the things i will be more grateful for thank you for all the important information you share here all my admiration from a venezuelan young student living in europe,positive
amazing video alex cant believe im just watching this now haha im a data scientist at a larger company and i wanted to also comment that theres also the data engineer role that is becoming more hot and covers the data cleaning and dashboard creation part,positive
great job on being concise in your comparisons between the two different job titles i begin my masters in data science this january i do plan to start applying to data analyst positions in the spring after i get my oracle database sql associate certification and may consider going for an aws cloud practitioner certification as well,positive
hello alex i currently hold a masters in healthcare informatics i am having trouble finding a job in my field i am wondering if i should be focusing on data scientist or data analyst i don’t have much experience when it comes to sql python etc i am wondering if i should consider enrolling in a data analytics boot camp what are your thoughts,negative
hi alex you mentioned something about learning awsazure for data analyst roles seeing that both of these cloud platforms have different coursesmodules where do you suggest we start from or is a generalist knowledge enough looking forward to your reply,positive
i really like how simple your explanation about ds and da very helpful i have been thinking to trying pursuing on ds career by following boot camp and course online despite of my background as bachelor of economic did you have some insight for nonstem background to undergoes this path thank you,positive
hello from italy alex as a data scientist i can say that we are more focused on deployng new models into a business process that drives direct value so the project management and the engeneering skills become really important unix professional coding sql git spark concept of testing and so on because you have to ensure that the pipeline works in every situation even when you have really bad or poor annotated data i dont think that you need a phd cause the algorithm that you use are pretty popular in the community xgboost bert resnet and so on,positive
great content as usual i dont know whether you already did a video about it but do you think that data analysis is going to be saturated in the next years with all these hype about data i was wondering if the offer of data analysis is going to be higher than the demand for these jobs thank you for spreading the knowledge about data,positive
reminder that all resources i mentioned are linked in the description thanks for watching everyone let me know what your goals for this year are below mine are do a project with a generative adversarial neural net enter at least 1 kaggle competition do at least 4 projects and share them on youtube,positive
so i have decided that 2022 will be the best year of my life ive started learning python on 1st day of the year and up till now i have covered most of the basics and made some simple programs as well in last 20 days so far its going good thank you for this video i wanted to ask when should i start practicing on kaggle now i study around 12 hours daily after my job and 34 hours on weekends,positive
i used your projectbased learning approach from last years video to learn data science after 15 months and 700 hours of learning no online courses just individual studying i landed as job as a midlevel data scientist in financial fraud detection thank you this video is spoton especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow 2 notobvious study habits which i found helpful 1 i kept multiple projects open so that after i went through a topic eg feature selection i could implement it in multiple projects 2 for each topic in my roadmap i kept a date of when i last implemented the technique in a project this helped me identify important topics which i had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten so that i could refresh my knowledgeskills,positive
been waiting for this video to anyone reading this if youre looking to break into data science in 2022 i 100 recommend subscribing to kens channel and following his advice back when covid19 started in 2020 i was looking to break into the field and i had no experience no projects and i didnt know where to start 6 months after subscribing to kens channel and soaking in all of his advice through his videos i got a job as a data analyst im living proof that this channel is 100 all that you need to get started thank you ken and i cant thank you enough for the doors you have opened for me,positive
lovely learning map ken and yes 430 math is very important love your channel and your content keep it up,positive
this updated video is epic your pioneering if i had to start over video had inspired so many similarly named videos in the tech youtube space certainly agree with you on the importance of coding and how that opened up several doors of opportunities in accessing power tools for the data science learning journey 801 also thanks for the mention ,positive
i’ve been waiting all year for this  solid advice ken,positive
great advice on typing out other peoples work myself as a beginner its easy to get flustered on projects as some solutionstools i have not yet been exposed to by looking up others solutionswork and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code furthermore sometimes the solutions dont work as i am using python 310 and so i have to work out and start fishing around for the latest iteration of the modulecode and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge,positive
hi first of all thank you very much for free courses i dont know i would be able to take benefit from this or not but i think you are doing a great job as i am chef in a hotel in uae and i am thinking if i could learn data science so that i can also explore new and better career i have no idea about computer science will i be able to get benefit from this 11 hour course if not then can you please suggest me a learning map kindly reply,positive
this was just what i needed ty for explaining exactly what they do and how,positive
i love this i belong here keep it up simplilearn,positive
please add timestamps it would be helpful,positive
also please suggest courses which are gonna help in conducting medical research data analysis,positive
nice video could you please add timestamps that would be great,positive
good job,positive

shane you should interview people on your channel that work in these fields theres a pretty big community on youtube of data scientist you can talk to people in all type of careers honestly theres insight they can bring that you only get by working in the field,positive
well explained topic thanks data rules the world and for businesses of all sizes it’s vital to effectively collect store and analyze the data to stay ahead of the competition,positive
i love seeing these videos from your channel pop up on my notifications you should do a poll on youtube to see what career we want to see next,positive
please do a video on the importance of top ranked universities in real world,positive
sweet i would also be interested in business intelligence jobs,positive
i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch 22 i feel like your video alluded to what i mean by democratization quite well so i think were probably in agreement there a lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models i think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and bigquery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away this opens ml models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and mlops we still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day for experience i really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people this is where i think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience the largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you i would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level my expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at 02 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5 years of experience so while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program together i think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals if workers with domain experience but not a ds education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job i think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree,positive
working as a phd in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data and it always shocks me how little they know id say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem my understanding are the best skills to have are 1 be able to identify problems 2 be able to decide how to solve the problem once that is done usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial though potentially data cleaning is time consuming but honestly dont trust me i had to go do a phd because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff,negative
prospective data scientists should focus on projects that demonstrate the ability to understand business context this this is very important,positive
the whole data science industry is booming from analyst to engineers to scientist and you will see domain experts leading this field more and more,positive
what a beautiful and insightful explanation of the dynamics of data science it is true that data science demand is growing exponentially and what aspiring data scientists are fearful is lack of knowledgeable that ds is actually evolving and diverse it is become more field specific and one need to master the area of expertise like health business banking etc in respect to the application of ds in it thanks a lot thu vu for your resourceful info,positive
this video was soooo informative and encouraging i’m a neuroscience major looking to enter data science after college and have been trying to focus my skills in learning r data visualization and statistical analysis class of ‘23,positive
not you being a literal life saver im graduating early and i had no clue what i could do with my applied mathematics degree without going to grad school and the way you describe this the constant learning the work environment honestly makes this sound like the job for me thank you,positive
i so needed this video today i just finished my masters in data analytics and as someone who has always despised job hunting i was getting disenfranchised but you have put the fire back in my belly all of the great things you said about the career are all the reasons i started the masters so thank you for reminding me,positive
hey awesome vid i was a data analyst before i had a maternity leave and i wanted so much to become a data scientist because i think its a logical progression of my work challenge path unfortunately currently i have different plans for my life but i wanted to say that you made me come back to my prev plans and inspired me again on the topic,positive
great video im quite interested in pursuing a career in data science in the future and im wondering if youve got any tipstricks for someone whos somewhat got his basics down looking forward to more of your videos,positive
i have a very similar background to you i am a former physics undergraduate that did research in high energy physics simulations and that computational background really helped me transition into my current data science position for any physicsmath undergrads you have the skill set to get into this field the only obstacle is being able to express your math knowledge through code if you can learn enough code to do that youre golden,positive
thank you for this video currently applying for a masters in data science and this is great anecdotal support,positive
very informative video i agree with many of your points and id like to add some of my own im a lead data scientist at an american unicorn 1 we dont really care about your background as long as you can code sql and python understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ml models your education might limit your progress later on but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entrylevel data scientist 2 communication is really important we expect all new hires to be good on the technical side so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high and lowlevel is how well you can understand whats being requested and whats important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business this is the number 1 thing i mention to my reports during 11s 3 many data science courses bas or masters dont teach sql or if they do its just basic stuff regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be sql will always be essential,positive
super informative thank you for all the info i just switched majors from cs to it and thinking of pursuing a masters degree in data science do you think that the masters degree would make of a difference early on and for entry level roles salary wise overall im just kind of trying to figure out where to go from here haha,positive
thank you so much for the insight on data science as a new path i have degree on agriculture and now im just starting on takin course professional certification and etc in data science im more interested into this stuff than my main degree tbh lol mainly just to get into ds job and also getting new skill to go along with my main degree seems pretty nice addition,positive
thank you for this course sir it was a great 12 hour journey coming from non cs background i had little to no knowledge about all this stuff but this video has given me enormous amount of confidence that i can program and explore data science further thanks again,positive
thanks for the course i’m playing this at 125x speed and it’s perfectly understandable and saves a couple of hours of reproduction,positive
thank you for doing such a good service to the community by bringing such amazing quality content for free i cant tell you how much i appreciate it lots of love and respect to the team,positive
you guys are loooooove may allah bless you fulfill your wishes,positive
this course came at the right time  gezz i needed to go back to the old drawing board because my python skills were not yet good enough to work on machine learning models haha,positive
thanks for this wonderful lecture video on ds with python for beginners i and going through it learning form it and loving it ive one doubt though when i am trying to write a multiline string the output is not exactly in multiline its in the following way this is line 1n this is line 2n this is last and final line line 3 please assist,positive
thanks for watching everyone i hope you have a better understanding of what it is like to be a professional data scientist sign up or learn more about sharpestminds here again sharpestminds is a data science mentorship marketplace that only gets paid when you land a job,positive
that’s a great concise video summing up the role of a professional data scientist this video came at the right moment as i transition from academia to industry and totally relate with many of the points mentioned in the video as mentioned in the later part of the video i also find the undesirable aspect of data science to be a doubleedged sword as on one end the ambiguity may make things unclear but at the same time also leaves room for experimentation and innovation papaya tracker sounds like an interesting personal project,positive
im 35 years old and i just started my data science journey by starting college this semester been an aircraft mechanic for my entire adult life and been looking for a change for years now and you inspired me to finally pursue data science thank you ken ill be tuning into your channel just to keep my ear to the ground in this exciting field also not sure if you spoke on this before but what laptop do you recommend for data science thanks buddy and keep up the good work,positive
this actually answered a couple of questions i had about working professionally i know that sw engineers typically work in an agile framework but wasnt sure if data science followed that same trend thanks ken now to watch this 400000 more times so we can beat forrest,positive
one of the most important things that i wish more people would do is documentation of datasets sources code rationale etc i often have to spend a long time on the dataset exploration phase of the project and trying to figure out things everything would be much smoother if people created detailed documents on the different datasets how things are collected what features are used distributions etc,positive
i’m 26 and i have one year left in my data science curriculum plus my master’s program currently learning mysql and i’m trying to learn python and r on the side it’s really tough since i’m in a data structures course using java and that takes up a good bit of my time hopefully it all works out for the best also trying to get a good grasp on machine learning and deep learning principles as i go and making sure i’m sharp with my statistics and linear algebra skills,positive
im working as an associate data scientists at a startup and i honestly havent needed to code for like 5 months theyve got me focused on an elearning initiative,positive
thank you for posting this video this past year i migrated to a new work role and am listed by my employer as a data scientist this video confirmed my understanding and also cleared up confusion as many people my employer and consumers of our products have different views of a data science work role,positive
as a data scientist myself i agree that anyone can become a data scientist it definitely takes a significant amount of time and effort though i have multiple videos about how to get into the field on my channel for those who are interested,positive
as a data scientist i would agree with the fact that we are lazy people that want maximum results with minimum effort and think we can solve any problem given enough data d,positive
anyone can be a data scientist thats the gist of this lecturewhat it requires is a combo of math stats n computer science skills topped u with communication and management soft skillsdata is the new thing from which physicists engineers social scientists can draw n infer conclusions based on past history or some kind of logicand this is the best time ever for fast processing of loads of dataright time to be data scientist you can work in any domain good introductory talk,positive
this was very precise and at the same time a very broad view at this field thank you sir,positive
thanks mrasitang mishra you have motivated me more to pursue data science ,positive
inspiring transparent talk ,positive
soooo good i love it and mr mishras smart humor very good overview with some fun laughs in it too,positive
felt proud watching being a data scientist i can relate what speaker said problem solving is the essence,positive
thanks a lot mrasitang mishra youve convinced me to study ds more,positive
this talk was really the best of its kind ,positive
i dont agree with any of this the only way to get a data science job is to first get a job as a janitor at an esteemed university start looking for math problems on chalk boards solve them become a professor solve math wait this is the plot from good will hunting nevermind in hindsight this is really great advice how about them apples,positive
great video tina loving the minimize input maximize output mimo series my step into the world of data was from a nontechnical biology background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts i also resonated with your prior mimo video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects i also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem that helps to make a positive impact in this video which at the time was a novel thing i repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it topics that i used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in your persistence through 200 swe roles is very inspirational ,positive
hey tina thank you so much for always sharing wonderful tips it is almost approaching a year since i had finished my bachelors and still without a job i really hope i can break the barrier and get my foot in the industry having zero experience makes everything harder apart from doing some projects i will definitely try to contribute in open source projects or pick up a consulting assignment,positive
im a ocean sciences bsc and now im starting another degree in information systems your channel is motivating me to follow the data science path keep up the awesome work,positive
amazing how much effort so many people put into to getting a job while someone with connection can bypass it all and get the job,positive
hi tina this was really great advice about demonstrating your impact super useful for data science people but i feel like its relevant to every field too please could you do a video on how you deal with rejection im job hunting in a field thats very new to me not data science at the moment and im just so afraid of getting rejected because that could mean the end of my dream also even if it doesnt the feeling just sucks lol,negative
hi tina do you think doing only analysis is good for your resume for example imagine that i scrape data from glassdoor and i do a analysis on the salaries of data scientists in the us after finishing the analysis on the data i got some pretty cool insights but i didnt use machine learning in the end project so is a project like that good for my resume im a major in data science and your videos help a lot,positive
honestly the frustrating thing for me at work as data analystscientist is i never saw our clients give any feedback about how our reports were helpful for them and change their projects aka business impact like what you described i always comfort myself that even just a little impact and thats enough,negative
hi tina you make me want to make my first comment on youtube your videos are super helpful and please keep making more interesting and insightful videos i am actually thinking of transitioning to data science from a business background and you gave me a lot of useful tips that solves my confusion,positive
hmmm im going the applied math route with stats as a minor or possibly masters is there any reason in particular that you would recommend compsci beyond just the programming background it provides also how different is data science compared to machine learning they sound almost like the same thing given their job descriptions great video btw,positive
glad we needed a scientist to tell us that you get rich by starting a business with a competitive advantage,positive
i feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop my two sisters worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses my sisters lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state she then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times,negative
so as a technician i worked at a dealership two actually owned by the same guy he has like 10 different dealerships and he is insanely wealthy like he owns all of this property north of a major highway and is literally like a king in these lands to be honest he also seems like a pretty nice guy,positive
since i was little i knew i’d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5 increase every year just sounds insane to me i studied software engineering so i could build my own tools and sell them took countless 70 hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries i’m interested in entrepreneurship is the way made my first m at 26 currently 27,negative
being a trade professional such as plumbing or hvac can be very lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years if you can become the name that people automatically think of for hvac problems you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you you can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire with a tech school diploma you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service,positive
remember he’s a data scientist he’s probably studied data on the topic immensely before this interview as that’s what we love doing especially with public data that’s nice to play with so the advice he’s giving probably tends to bounce towards what’s most probable not what will definitely make you rich in most ways probability can you take you a long way,positive
wow what a great course with an awesome professor he goes way beyond teaching the mechanics of statistics but makes distinctions and asks thought provoking questions that really help you crystallize in your head what you are trying to do,positive
absolutely the best video on statistics that i have found on youtube and ive viewed several such videos i like that the professor explains a topic from many angles has charisma patience with class questions and includes many realworld examples its the perfect blend of theory and applied statistics,positive
as practicing design engineer in west cost medical industry i find professor dr sarkar way of explaining the most complex subject in a practical approach very rewarding and helps in right metal representation for long term understanding although i have taken similar courses in stanford paying close to 2k plus usd came out even more confused and even gave up statistical approach thanks for sharing for free and hope this benefits the transition from excel based modeling to python and would highly recommend to any one working with data and design,positive
thanks a lot for putting up such great content the instructor took a very practical approach to ds rather than just theories,positive
wonderful content and presentation i feel like i missed drsarkar sir all these days thanks to greatlearning team for these lectures it will be great if a video is made up on time series analysis also thanks team for all your effort and introduce to us the great professor drsarkar sir,positive
he is really a great professor i have been studying statistics since school and then using years for my profession however the way he teach and explain from one chapter to another chapter and subject is super thanks,positive
i am greatly impressed with this lecture so simplified with imaginable analogies thank you so much sir and the greatlearning team,positive
fantastic course for those who have a fear factor of stats and probability this course will certainly will help allay those fears dr sarkar focused on concepts with perfect analogies which helps understand the subject better thank you dr sarkar,positive
this was really the best course i did learned alot and earned the certificate of completion as wellthank you so much great learning for this beautiful content and drabhinanda sarkar sir is the best is explaining thingsthank you very much greatlearning,positive
it becomes over whelming to see the job requirements for a data science role in india its hard not to fall in the trap of not knowing a lot of stuff even having a strong foundation in python probability and statistics also ive taken a few courses from you guys till 15th of april and they were awesome but would you also recommend us some of the projects we can have in our portfolio which will help us stand out,positive
great videos and great data science courses i used the free preview option and i am happy to learn data science and machine learning thanks so much for this opportunity,positive
this was a very nice and informative video hopefully i can get a data scientistanalyst position with only a bachelors degree but i should consider graduate programs in my area thanks,positive
your courses are amazing thank you for bringing us this opportunity 365 data science team,positive
hello i have a question related to your area of studies chart if i study a degree in computer science and then i study a data science master in your area of studies chart i would be on computer science on data science and analysis or in both this doesnt much sense i think thanks a lot i enjoy your videos,positive
the introductory course that you offer in tableau is awesome,positive
the way you conduct lessons are awesome,positive
i am always waiting to see your new videos the premiere option is great choice to do,positive
ohmygod that was such a great video and exactly what i was looking for i am about to start a data science masters next year and was looking for an overview on how to best prepare for it and you gave me that and so much more even combined with such a great presentation how is your channel that small please continue what you are doing you are awesome,positive
thank you for this ive been searching for this breakdown for a long time clear concise and to the point,positive
such an amazing vibe thanks for the really cool videos been looking into data science post studies in industrial engineering your channel has beereally informative thanks you,positive
hello ive been watching this youtube channel a lot and found it really helpful if you dont mind me asking a simple question is it quite common to solve normal algorithm coding test the one that for swe for usual for a ds interview thank you,positive
a question ive been asking myself for years never went to college but crushed ap stat and calc in high school 10 years ago lol have been interested to see what to expect in brushing the dust off this knowledge,positive
killer video i think one area that is always overlooked in a predictive field like data science is causality its a really important area in order to understand how confounding can impact model power really digging your videos by the way,positive
such an amazing vibe thanks for the really cool videos been looking into data science post studies in industrial engineering your channel has been really informative thanks,positive
great video theres just so much to unpack when it comes to data science,positive
i am officially on a quest to watch all your videos you are great btw what would you recommend for someone pivoting into the field with no experience,positive
finished the video it feels like a game changer in terms of perspective to me plus its so informative and you can be so funny thank you,positive
very helpful content for beginnersneatly explainedrefreshed topics which i learnt with good examples,positive
thank you so much you people are always on top of expectations ,positive
you guys are just awesome your learning technique is too goodkeep it up and thank you so much to all edureka team,positive
u guys r just awesome keep it up the vedios aroused my interest in data science,positive
one of the best youtube channel for data science which explained every concepts deeply,positive
thank you so much for this content it changed my life and turned me into completely different person i tell about what i do in terms of artificial intelligence cyberspace software development drones and lifestyle on my channel i would highly appreciate your feedback,positive
my dude humbled by the shoutout  i disagree though 1029 your videos are the ones that are on a whole other level ,positive
“don’t quit” is definitely one of the biggest pieces of advice for people wanting to break into the field took me a year and a half of that horrible trial and error learning quitting starting again and networking to finally land my da role and i don’t regret a second of that journey,positive
amazing content stefan i’m currently a student at a university in florida majoring in business analytics and information systems which yeah basically trained you to become a data analyst i’m a senior now but i feel like i learned shit in the last 3 years despite getting all a and paying tons of money i learned from your videos way more than in the college classroom,positive
considering i am extremely broke this was massively helpful bc you recommended free ways to learn various things and i desperately need that i also need to know what skills will be most useful to hiring managers and recruiters and how to effectively prove it in my cv so that was also very appreciated the very structured approach to this video was extremely helpful thank you very much,positive
i cannot tell you how much i appreciate this video nowhere else ive seen someone telling it like it is in such a concise way thank you subscribed to lukes channel following your recommendation as i also see data analysis as a stepping stone,positive
i needed to hear this i am starting the journey of becoming a data analyst at 52 thank you so much,positive
excellent video ive seen tons of this starting videos and you actually gave practical and specific tips to start thank you,positive
thanks a ton brother that was really resourceful and the exact advice i was looking for  also if you could suggest any useful certifications to consider that would add up well in the profile that would be great thanks again ,positive
its so important that people like you come up with such good content in order to teach folks that data science is not just about programming language and applying random ml libraries to get 90 efficiency like you said math and stat is always the key and everyone should start with that even though we dont often use it in real world scenario in companies,positive
this video was helpful im currently a ux researcher and have my feet in both qualitative and quantitative research where the quantitative requires a lot of data analysis i enjoy diving into data but wasnt sure which route i should take for my particular job to build out more of a niche in a quant ux researcher role now i feel like i know more of what i want to dive into further and want to focus more on the data analysis route,positive
1 on the book it is a great resource to start with and it also has coding exercises which helps a lot with practicing stats and coding,positive
hi maam sincerely thank you for sharing such a valuable information especially for me as i have been just wandering on yt and other mediums to just get started i want to remember this day and this video down the lane when i figure out where i belong in the venn diagram and achieve it thank you for pointing out a much efficient approach and direction truly sharat,positive
thank you so much i was literally feeling lost to figure out what should i learn first python r sql now i got hope thank you so much for your videos,positive
i absolutely agree with your comments about statistics and i loveownhave read the same book cover to cover there is now a 2nd edition with python implementation btw reason i am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions i recently went through google data scientist interview 1 hour tech screen and to my surprise the question was straight out coin flip probability and expectation problem i was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and i couldnt come up with the answer very easily at first that was the only question some resume related question before that of course i got in the session as a data scientist myself those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally i dont think itd help to measure ones understanding of stats or technical background how would you suggest prepare those,positive
thank you for such an informative video appreciate people from real time experienceare sharing it with people which will he a great help to so many im working as a software engineer but dont think im good at technical so was thinking to move to non technical roles and these thoughts are really tiring when u end up in too many options and not able to conclude i am with bsc maths and msc computers background and in 2016 thought searched so much how to utilise my maths skills in it but unfortunately couldnt find so much that timenow when i hear on data scene i feel i lost so much opportunity but i would like to resstart my learning and your videos are really inspiring is it okay for a person with almost 8years gap from bsc maths to start on data science now please reply,positive
thanks for sharing your experience in transitioning to data scientist role some of your suggestion is good which is actually what im doing so far watching different you tube video on on same topic because as you pointed out different people has their own way of interpretation of the subject and is more simplified until you fully grasp the subject please keep sharing your knowledge,positive
valuable content and glad to see someone pointing out a book they read because its not easy to pick a good book as theres many of them thank you for sharing,positive
hey sundas great video thanks for sharing your tips i have one suggestionrequest on a topic you should do i video on paths of carrer progression in data scienceanalytics this will be helpful for people like me who have already spent a year or two in data science field to understand what are the directions you can take to progress in this field,positive
what a journey hard work always pays off thanks for sharing and motivating us all,positive
awesome video i completed 2 years of medical school but had to withdraw due to my poor physical health chronic pain computer science was my backup if i was unable to get into medical school im currently learning python through udemys online course the tech world is so broad and i feel overwhelmed im hopeful that things will workout for me in the end but med school debt is no joke,positive
great video thanks for sharing all of your experiences how difficult was it to be proficient in spark it’s such a different mindset,positive
thank you for a lovely video i must admit that what you said really helped me reevaluate some things about how i have been handling my own situation thank you in fact i like the video so much that i clicked the like button seventeen times,positive
love your videos i would love for you to talk more about your experience with working at a startup,positive
thank you very much for sharing your educational background with us exciting as ever,positive
perfect time for me to find your channel as i will begin pursuing an ms data science degree at vanderbilt in the fall looking forward to more great content from you,positive
the wait is over glad to see you back on the youtubes ,positive
very informative i’ve got an engineering degree and had courses like probability statistics linear algebra integral and differential calculus i have a letter of acceptance from a community college in canada for business and advanced analytics in a post grad diploma program with subjects like python sql machine learning etc i’m studying python and data science online at the moment in preparation for my winter 2023 intake will brush up my knowledge on statistics linear algebra and calculus by august as this is a requirement by the program back in the days i had the opportunity to represent our school in math competitions what surprises me is that i can still study for 5 8 straight hours everyday and sometimes forgetting my businesses as i now leave my managers to decide on their own what do you think are the chances of people in their mid 40’s getting a job without experience as a data analyst or data scientist,positive
this helped me realise that i am more interested in building things rather than discovering them what a great and informative video thank you tina,positive
i have a masters of data science but once i started working in a data position i have realized that i enjoy more of the coding and building whether its writing python sql or r code for building and analyzing data or building reports in ssrs those are the aspects of my job that i most enjoy i have been considering changing careers to software engineering also i do feel like data scientists are expected to know too much these days from communication data visualization statistics and deep learning to cloud platforms spark and now docker that is a ton of skill and knowledge that seems superhuman,positive
great explanation building products vs discovering insights,positive
as someone who is working in the data analytics side i wholeheartedly agree with this data science is a new field which basically supports or optimizes how to do business software engineering leans more on building software or applications where normal people can useconsume if you want to create your own business in the tech industry software engineering should be necessary if you want to support existing businesses data science is the way im planning to create my own business on the food industry and i can see that data science can help it a lot,positive
thanks for the informative video just a caveat on the salary comparison data science often requires graduatelevel education masters or phdconsiders it an asset whereas software engineers do not or if without a graduate degree its not uncommon to work as a data analyst for 12 years before becoming a data scientist so while the average salary may be higher for data scientists theres likely some additional educationwork experience factored in,positive
this is the most systematic and detailed review of any of the two careers i’ve ever seen thanks for this video it definitely helped in finding my next step,positive
this helped me soo much i was really on the fence but im leaning towards software development just because i have serious doubts that i could present the data in a parsableusable way i like coding so ill stick with that but i also love working with numbers so im hoping i can land a data analyst job somewhere down the line thanks for providing the insight,positive
this is the video everyone should watch when starting to learn data science  so many great lessons in this thu ,positive
a great tour de force video thu many thanks for putting this together so much great information will be taking notes on my 2nd and 3rd viewings keep up the good work,positive
this is just excellent bravo for packaging so much information and insights in such short time and positive energy thank you thu,positive
excellent video i love how you presented the contentits packed full of information and you get straight to the point with interesting graphics theres lots of value add in this 14 min video great work putting this together subbed,positive
great tips thanks for sharing really resonated with knowing what to learn and keeping the momentum even if its 2 minutes,positive
watching your videos gives me inspiration to keep going and avoid total burnout i let go software engineering bootcamp for data science hence your videos also contribute to my productive day and my mental health,positive
hi thu you are amazingggg i was just looking for a video like this and you uploaded it cannot thank you enough your videos so informative so focused directionally and full of personal experiences and could not find any other person sharing such information thank you for sharing all of this,positive
dear thu thank you for sharing your guidence as being an aspiring data scientist it would be a lot of confusion on path what to learn and what not to your video covers it well i find it is a good guidence to me thanks,positive
thank you so muchh for your great sharing its really useful for me since i just started learning data analysis for my career change really love the content 3,positive
i think to move faster u have to make your basics strong python ds ml concepts sql concepts etc some error can be solved if the basics is clear,positive
im so happy that you started giving courses on machine learning i appreciate your clear teaching style,positive
words are not enough to appreciate what you present in your channel i do believe you are number one in programming,positive
for info 1 at 3252 to avoid userwarning x does not have valid feature names we need to train the model with the values of inputdataset ie use xvalues instead of x in modelfitxvalues y 2 4204 joblib is now a seperate py package we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearnexternals anyway thanks mosh for another great tutorial,positive
finally i found something practical rather than theoretical thank you sir,positive
mister mosh thank you for all of the easy to follow tutorials that you make for us please keep keep up the good work i hope you post more courses preferably in python,positive
im so glad i stumbled upon this you are amazing this was very pleasant and easy to follow i learned a ton and i especially like that you took us through your thought process while examining the music data set too thank you very much subscribed,positive
you are the reason why i started programming ill never forget the things youve done to help me,positive
thank you so much very clear and neat explanation i hope you will continue diving deeper into detailed concepts rather than concentrating only on basics your way of explanation plus the details would be the great video for all i think,positive
amazing tutorial you explained everything so clearly and helped me to grasp some of the topics even better,positive
hey mosh your contents and teaching style are straightforward and easy to follow it would be great help if you do some tutorials based on medical imaging ctmri data i am having difficulties in dealing with those thank you,positive
thanks for watching everyone let me know if you think data science is on the rise or decline below,positive
the data science king  has spoken data science is not dying very much agree with this ken i also will add that i feel there is going to be a stronger need for data engineering as we go into the future,positive
as someone whos a relatively new data scientist thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that i needed ken ,positive
great insights ken i certainly agree that data sciences decline is far from sight in the life science domain the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and theres a whole new frontier of possibilities,positive
the sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist rejection and unclear expectations most companies have no idea how to find and sort datascientists may make many believe that is was just a fad and they came a little late to the party,negative
great insights as always ken the data science umbrella is so large that several titles will be more defined by companies to find the person with the skill set required to solve their problems,positive
data science is definitely not dying and for the fact its only scaling much bigger companies have started seeing the advantage of using data and data science and organisations are adopting data which is in fact create more demand for data experts ,positive
currently building up skills to eventually try and become a data analyst enjoyed the dope content should def do some more,positive
justin not only great editng but loved how you shared the life of a data analyst looking forward to more content from you ,positive
this is so easy to understand and inspiring to see data analysts daily life thank you for making such a useful video,positive
omg this is awesome this the only real day in a life ive ever seen usually its just some blog eating fancy food and going to the gym never telling exactly what they do but this guy did it correctly congrats,positive
this was so much fun to watch and immensely encouraging for me to continue my studies,positive
awesome video are there any other tech skills being applied to your typical workday outside of sql perhaps excel python etc,positive
i love this and even the food vlog portion im a recruiter so its interesting to see what its like in the roles i commonly get to work on thanks for the great experience and video,positive
what an awesome video thank you for sharing it for someone that wants to become a da as a career what kind of courses or learnings would you suggest they take in the beginning for example excel power bi sql vba etc,positive
as a person who needs to deal frequently with data at my office my biggest nightmare is not getting required data from the stakeholders,negative
i am from newyork and i am happy that you shared this video with us and the life i have dreamt about i am in my final year of college and i have been applying to a lot of job opportunities what kind of projects do you recommend to entry level data analyst i have been making dashboard in tableau and doing my analysis in excel and sql where do you get the datas to do self projects,positive
use my link and check out the first chapter of any datacamp course for free to unlock new career opportunities and become data fluent today,positive
this makes me so excited to be a data scientist thank you for the video,positive
hi priya thank you for this video i am concluding my last year as a student receiving my bs in data analytics and i have so many questions that are causing me anxiety as i am nearing the end of my journey i have realized that the path in computer science dsda is not structured like one probably imagined it would be what i am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools python sql tableau r if what’s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them but the real challenge starts after graduating in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs i have beginner level on all these programs right now but i feel like i probably won’t be able to land a job in data analytics until i’m at least intermediate in sql and at least python for starters i would appreciate your feedback and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science,negative
thank you for this video this is extremely helpful as i am currently applying to data science and quantitative analytics positions,positive
want to quickly commend you for the consistency and quality of your content i dont usually comment but from helping me with my uchicago application where i will be attending next year d to now supporting me in identifying my future career i am very interested in data science i am grateful to you for all your work thanks,positive
1000 this is an extremely hard coding task it deals with a custom datatype implies the iteration and verification of the end i wasted 40 minutes and didnt resolve it all the solutions i have found include flattering with a separate method than iterating and len verification and the task is formalized in a way that next and hasnext methods should be enough to do the flattening which is again more difficult i am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune500 company coding interview comparing this with the explanation of the gradient descend is like chalk and cheese,negative
great video i appreciate the honesty did you start as an analyst before moving to a data scientist role what role would you recommend for recent grads,positive
a scientist who works in data science has been a godsend finding a job has been difficult in the wake of my graduation and several unsuccessful job applications after weighing my options i chose to leave physics and hunt for a position in data science before seeing your videos i was baffled as to why i continued being turned down for jobs despite having two masters degrees one in physics and the other in applied physics now that ive seen some of your vids i understand why glad i found your channel on youtube,positive
just start my datacamp journey thank you for this helpful insight i have one question how do you know that some company just using you for their free project while they actually dont want to hire anyone,positive
very understandable approach to explaining the differences in these roles its definitely appreciated especially with the blurred lines that companies often use to represent these fields,positive
really nice video i am a current data analyst at a large tech company hoping to become a ml engineer eventually similar to a google software engineer whose capable of everything in that chart love the content keep it up,positive
great video thanks for clearing that up and explaining the various elements of so many different roles in this field very helpful,positive
i am a marketing project manager and i was wondering if i could shift my path to data scientistanalyst and your amazing video made it clear for me thanks very much,positive
subs ive been seeing your video on my feed for a while now since i started roaming around to study software development but my true goal was to go up to the data scientist role thats just the goal i have in mind and you just revealed to me that i dont exactly need to become a software engineer first if i can land myself to a data analyst role the hierarchy showed me i can still walk up slowly to reaching my goal you are a god send,positive
thanks man for clearing this up especially in india all it companies have made a mess about data jobswhy dont you make a video dscussing these jds especially from india these all are mncs,negative
thats a very nice explanation id love to see each step indepth,positive
this video helped me pass my data scientist interview thanks,positive
i love your videos i had one quibble about your sql solution to 1 if some publishers have more videos than others then their video durations will affect the mean you could imagine one publisher with 10000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos in this case the average duration of that one superpublishers videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers i think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages of course this detail may not matter in an interview,positive
lol very impressive that you can make a video about interview questions so fun to watch  ,positive
i really love your channel it has helped me understand what ds really is i am an incoming freshmen and will be pursuing ds this seems hard right now but as the years go this will all make sense keep up the good work,positive
i think this is a good video for suggestions on how to get a data science job at a larger company however in my experience data science interviews at nonlarge companies put a huge focus on machine learningdeep learning linear algebra statistics core python programming sometimes r sql sparkawsgcp and data visualization tableau matplotlib r,positive
hi jonathan awesome video please rate the online data science or big data courses and share your opinion regarding if they are any good in landing you a job vs a masters in cs,positive
dude love the cut outs great video,positive
maaaaaan the way you explain stuff makes me feel like this is something reachable despite of its level of complexity you make it sound somehow easy not because it is but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own there are many out there who put themselves on a superior position maybe caused by their formaleducation ego but for some reason you must follow their same steps which means youll never be as awesome as they are thanks for breaking it down for humans big hug from argentina and keeping on rocking with that good work ,positive
update comment i’m one month into my new career as a data analyst at a large charter school company over 20 analysts on our team i just wanted to come back here and say thank you i focused on positions within education changing from a 14 year career as a math teacher and landed a position within a month of starting my job search sql and excel are used a lot my advice to anyone starting out is to get comfortable with those two programs especially inner joins with sql and pivottables with excel,positive
fantastic video as a ba i can attest that sql and excel are still very much in demand after being at one job for 15 years i had to put myself back on the market after doing the excel sql and powerbi assessments on linkedin to back my resume ahead of the screenings the jobs and some cool offers started rolling right in,positive
this is great i am trying to transition from salesmanagement to data analyst and eventually data science great video to help individuals like myself transitioning careers into something they truly enjoy problem solving,positive

just learning enough moving on and iterating that’s a great tip when learning almost anything i tend to go deeper in one of the initial steps and feel stuck,positive
love the strategy and the “not getting too deep into one subject” advice definitely better to know a bit of everything than only one thing very well especially for interviews,positive
this is pretty much how i went through it as well in the last few years i actually started web scraping before machine learning as ml really benefits from good scrapers and database building,positive
ive been so stressed about how to best learn data science without wasting time and this is so helpful,positive
hi tina thank you for providing these useful info for learning data science knowledge im going to pursue a msds soon and iv learned python ml mysql and some hadoop during my free time beside working on some resume projects and keep practicing the skills are there anything i can do to ensure myself getting an intern thank you very much,positive

i would like to thank all the youtube teachers for explaining the topics crystal and clear,positive
thanks krish i was looking for a video that could clarify the differences between ai mc dp and data science and after looking all around youtube i found your video it was awesome im looking forward your next videos hugs from brazil ,positive
finally a good explanation that doesnt hide confusion behind jargon thanks,positive
hi krish i have always been interested in ai and things around it about it you nailed it man a naive like me who has some faint idea of ai could simply understand and know further about dl ml too very useful video thanks much,positive
hai sir thank you for this video i dont know even a single alphabet in this subject when compared to all other viewers but now a days i hear a lot about artificial intelligence ml dl ds around me so i thought to at least know what they mean i struck the correct video at the first attempt and i put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing the lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software i just use word xl for my job has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered if i have understood then the people who are already in this subject would have got a lot of useful information now if i tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how i could knew about this subject thanking your sir once again i am 57yrs old can i learn and become de or da or ds,positive
currently watching as the quarantine period is in process and this helped me understand thank you for this amazing explanation 3 3,positive
i am a structural engineer this is a good field for data science since most civil engineers dont learn programmingcoding and when they do they just shift to it industry data science will be very crucial for monitoring the life of structures,positive
thank you professor for giving such crucial information how about mis management in information systems for ms in usa does even that has the same supplydemand ratio problem or is it safe bet to pursue masters in that field throw some light on it professor,positive
thank you for this video i am going for a phd in business data science and was wondering what steps i can take to make sure that i can be successful in this field i have worked as a data scientist in fintech companies in india for 2 years and now going forward with my graduate studies your videos have been very inspirational,positive

you are doing an excellent job free education is more appreciable which needs a good heart thank you for your great service,positive
thanks for watching what does your data science path looks like,positive
thanks for the shout out sundas great video,positive
hi sundas great video i am trying to make a switch from operations to analytics and i learned excel and tableau first and then learnt to code completely agreed that knowing the tool isn’t enough you gotta be a pro to make them believe you have what it takes,positive
thanks for the video sundas i still struggle to know what data science role i want to do id love to hear more of your thoughts on picking direction when you dont yet have experience theres a big gap between the skills i have now and some of the positions i am interested but im hoping that i can still move around in the field as i learn more my data science journey started last year during the pandemic when i was locked out of my phd lab and needed to do something productive my process so far 1 data science in r series from harvard on edx 2 reading practical statistics for data science with a bookclub 3 python programming course pre4 learned some linear algebra calculus 4a ml course 4b data science fellowship with ds4a now learning sql online always engage in ds community and attend talks to learn about various topics next applied machine learning class to do some project work and also i should finish my phd this semester,positive
its so greatfull of you sundas mam to mentor us gracefully im just 18 but see my future as data scientist and always get many more to learn from u mam please keep motivating students like me and others as well need more videos on data scientist,positive
hi sundas i am a chemical engineer working in industrial automation for several years i spent several years drawing conclusions from tons of process trendings and doing data visualization when i i didnt know what it really was until i found your ig and thats when i knew i was into data analytics i am doing the google data analytics certificate course and it is great so far i am also hesitating to stepping into the data scientist role but i will see how the data analytics goes first thanks for inspiring me to give my career a new direction changing at 35 is not easy,positive
thanks so much for clearing it out i am learning data science on my own i started learning statistics few months ago almost done i was a little confused and restless if i made the right choice by learning statistics first i read a lot of comments on quora where people said that coding should be the first step it didnt make much sense to me now its all clear and i have gained confidence after watching your video i have a similar road map to what you just said thanks so much for inspiring and giving us so much info all the best and really looking forward to watch your future videos,positive
thank you so much for this ideas you are very correct and i got to know that as it fell in line with the structure of datacamp schedule where i am learning data science now i also appreciate you for mentioning kaggle because i have been thinking where or how can i implement the little i have learnt well done ,positive
check my new video where i made a metroidvania using microsoft paint only it’s pretty epic,positive
quite a lot of progress for 1 year congrats and keep learning,positive
woah truly got surprised to see this channel with 25k subs the editing and content was spectacular earned a sub from me excited to see what other content you’ll be coming out with,positive
great editing brother had my attention the entire time,positive
this video is really good editing voice over creativity everything in every sense,positive
im most impressed by your animations honestly very nice,positive
even your early games made more from boredom than interest are impressive you learned so much game dev in a year makes me feel more motivated to start in earnest,positive
i started making game yday second attempt here too 1 year ago i tried and failed and im so happy when i heard that what im going through is normal its really hard to stick to something nowadays and when you said something about making game simple so you dont quit i really felt that lmao anyways good luck on making gta 6 in 2023 mate,positive
really humorous and inspiring great stuff,positive
this was a really interesting video ive been toying around with the idea of making my own game after seeing toby fox and eric barone do it on their own but ive always feared the learning process when i probably should have been excited for it on a side note are you dutch or belgian a lot of my favourite content creators have a similar accent to yours and ive taken note of how many content creators there are from these countries makes me wonder if certain culturally facilitated living standards leads to more content creators,positive
game dev in my head im gonna make a hyper realistic level with amazing movement combat and an adaptive ai game dev in reality help ive imported a mesh and crashed my computer,negative
this video is really good and legit i do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age there are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free the learning process to build an entire game is long and difficult especially if youre thinking of an rpg in my experience single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience multiplayer games are a stretch to even tryalone or with a small team but dont let the reality beat you up if you really really want something you can make it happen ive been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years and have prototypedconcepted my own rpg 5 times only now in 2022 am i confident enough to build the official version but ive done it ive learned enough to make it happen and you can too knowing is one thing then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life creation is king never give up,positive
this is exactly why i respect game developers i once made a simple arcade game with a bit of coding with c and i swear i almost put a hole in my monitor because the code wasnt working the way i wanted it to but when you finally do get the code to work what you feel is almost indescribable,positive
games are the most complex type of media cause they take all aspects of creativity together,positive
solo dev here and the part about marketing is totally true my game shameless plug link on my channel trailer was a complex effort where i learned a lot about animation music and sound mixing some seemingly simple things like sound settings and zoom took the longest during development and when it was all over people who played my game said it was pretty good but it was hardly even seen by anyone the marketing thing was something i never considered so its going to be a focus with my next game i made a game and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places and that i naively expected steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there if anyones wondering how accurate this video is the answer is somewhere around 120 great video too editing was great and music was well chosen,positive
my game arcadian rift is now available on steam for wishlisting please consider adding it 3,positive
i think the best part of this video is that his advice can be used for more than just game development,positive
the most important thing i took away from my programming professor is if your code is doing the thing you intended it to thats the right way to do it dont get hung up on doing it the right way you can always optimize later,positive
i love how you are being open to your community this helps the community to feel engaged in your projects anyways i feel like this advice of yours can really help me in what i need to do so thanks hope you have a great day also what if you release your pizzatime game to public xd,positive
honestly cant thank you enough for this im just starting off picking an engine and while im going to be doing it solo a lot of this advice is helpful beyond just game development being a visual artist as well i can actually attest to how important the bit about isolation is nothing gasses up your motivation like being able to cross pollinate ideas and support each other,positive
i am so excited to start my dev journey thankyou for the inspo,positive
one year insane im gonna get there 11 months to go,positive
i feel more confident that i can actually learn gamedev knowing yanderedev made something that a lot of people enjoyed and he didnt even know most of the info in this video,positive
can’t wait to make my first game for the airplane ,positive
ive been a dev for 3 years and have never had development explained in this way i think this is one of the best development videos for beginners,positive
just what i needed to know to start making my first game call of mario,positive
such a great simplified yet essential breakdown,positive
i feel like he is that one computer coding teacher that actually put it in a way that we understand thanks for the basics ,positive
use my link and check out the first chapter of any datacamp course for free to unlock new career opportunities and become data fluent today,positive
i really can agree with it increased my appreciation for those games since ive got into game dev i know hoooow much work for exaple aaa games like red dead 2 are,positive
i just finished my first month of learning game dev with unity and seeing this motivates me and excites me to see just how much i can learn in the next 2 months thanks for this video,positive
preoptimisation is my biggest weakness as a sw engineer it kills a lot of passion and motivation for projects if it’s not perfect it’s very hard to correct,negative
love how you added rpg maker as a game engine there very underated but very amazing,positive
im not sure how i got recommended this from the youtube algorithm but im glad i did after mindlessly eating half a box of cheezits and finishing the video i was surprised to see the view count the editing was great and i was thoroughly intrigued i havent seen any other of your videos but i hope you get one that blows up you seem to be going in the right direction though because i got recommended this video despite sparingly watching tech content best of luck,positive
thank you for making this i fall into the trap of scheduling too i’ve recently adopted your method of just working on it when i want to it makes the dev much more enjoyable using monogame instead of unity tho amazing video,positive
“i thought it would ruin the magic of video games” if anything it enhances it tenfold for me anyway i love thinking about how things could possibly be programmed whenever i’m playing a game sometimes i think of how i would tell a computer to complete daily tasks like pouring a glass of water,positive
finalbossblues is awesome ive been subscribed for ages for my own projects and i know the number of tutorials isnt quite as high but i would recommend godot to 2d beginners its relatively clean and easy to pick up completely open source and less than 1gb i think the steam version is 950mb but the full package straight off the website is closer to 100mb and yet still fully functional so very quick and easy to try out i really like gdscript pythonesque and the scene heirarchy is pretty intuitive i admit i keep getting hung up on optimisation not just because like you i work in another development area during my day job but because i want anything i make to be playable on a potato if possible but it really slows downhalts my progress need to shoulder my way through that like you recommend,positive
thankyou so much for your support over the last few weeks its honestly been so crazy also make sure you join the discord server,positive
tbh this gives me inspiration being someone who has wanted to make games since a very very young age i have had the idea to make my own little studio called the crying arcade and im just now learning how to do stuff seeing the amount of progress you made with just a moving cube it genuinely gives me hope it makes me feel like i have a chance thanks man,positive
after 1 year in unity i see you have improved so much keep it up at this rate you will hit 10k 100k or even 1m,positive
thats great your history of creating video games is so interesting such motivation to start unity,positive
i really want to learn c in unity so this is definitely something to look up to,positive
your first games are actually very impressive the problem i had and have rn is learning coding on unity there is now where to learn c,positive
the rate at which youre growing is amazing you had 2k subscribers 2 months ago and now you have over 30k wish you the best for the future of this channel,positive
i am a complete beginner at game dev and this vid really inspired me to keep going so thanks for making this vid,positive
hey man… keep up the good work your progress is amazing,positive
awesome video very inspiring just started my c journey a while back and gonna be jumping in unity soon i hope i will be making as much progress as you did damn,positive
hi everyone i realized i didnt actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games thats why ethical monetization is my specialty now so for sure theres data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions it also encompasses monetization and systems design though i wasnt formally trained in monetization design before joining its actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first monetization design encompasses things like battle passes loot box designs game ecoystem design hard currency to soft currency what resources are tradable and purchasable etc designing events and seasons what content should be available how is it distributed what does progression and rewards look like in an event etc and ofc the pricing of it all we also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones we often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction purchase regret mau revivals etc to get a sense of this my role today though focuses on a broader list of things not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well i made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out,positive
this video was really inspiring and insightful to watch thank you for sharing your story and also the tip on “skillset to interest framework” i never thought of that idea especially since i am someone who doesn’t necessarily know what roles i would be a best fit for but also that matches my current skillset still in the process of exploration anyways thank you for the video,positive
great to hear your story was an amazing journey please use your smarts for good and make game monetization less predatory for all who play the games you work on its an incredibly important issue and im so happy to hear that people are thinking about and specializing in work like that,positive
hi morgan just want to tell you that i really loved the skillset to interest framework it really did a good job im not a gamerelated worker but this thing helps me up to retrospect my career skill set thanks for making this video,positive
loved this video there are so many videos that just say do this this and youll eventually get into the industry but you managed to break your journey down into a series of manageable steps looking forward to seeing more content from you,positive
only halfway into the video the way of breaking down the job roles within the industry has been immensely helpful and information friendly to new gamers designers or hopefuls wanting to join the game industry,positive
its a very informative video and its genuinely interesting to hear your journey on the other hand the title is definitely a clickbait the video has very little to do with how to become a developer rev analyst is not a developer nor is the product manager role,positive
morgan this is awesome one because i love league of legends been playing since like season 6 and its just amazing to see people that have a vision for their life plan work hard to achieve it and succeed im one of those as well got a degree in neurosciencepsychology fell in love with web dev learned the skills that i needed and been working as a web dev for about 6 months and life has been a dream ever since,positive
you have achieved more in 2 years that a whole team of people in 3 absolutely phenomenal,positive
congrats on two years of exciting development incredibly inspiring,positive
congrats man on your 2 years youre a legend,positive
dude honestly this just looks amazing and i think its simply inspiring to see someone make this possible it means we could do it as well maybe if we work as hard as you,positive
i remember seeing your first devlog 2 years ago and just knowing it wasnt going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right i havent seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i dont think i will ever see anything like this again if i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you i cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month awesome work keep it up and best of luck 1740 also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesnt enough also to whoever concepted the humanoid characters awesome job looks dope,positive
noice congrats on 2 years the concept art for enemies and missions is looking sick and im excited for what the future holds ,positive
ive been watching since the start this is the best devlog ever and i cant wait till its done,positive
bro this is genuinly nuts an inspiration to a lot of us the amount you have got done and learned in 2 years is crazy good job,positive
its absolutely nuts that this is your first game project and it looks so promising already just imagine what youll be able to do in the future if this one is a success,positive
i didnt know mark is such a pretty good artist those art concepts and sprites for his old game ideas looks really nice i always thought the phase of prototype is always super important to make sure if a game is gonna be good i think is possible to already have these characters and this music and this story if thats the goal of a game still i can see how game design can evolved those concepts into something more fitting for whatever the gameplay can be,positive
im the dev who integrated 2d physics into unity and i thoroughly enjoyed watching this i think ill be going into the attic to dig out my folder of ideas from my youth too,positive
reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters we had a course that was just making a game in groups of 5 after week 1 of production everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing i felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked why does it look so pretty as a critique for this exact reason he seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early because it was too early too tell if their idea worked yet they had spent time making it look amazing,positive
gmt dont over think or over prepare your game me with adhd and wanting to make a metroidvania style game visible sadness,negative
i really recommend you checking out a book “the art of game design” and it’s chapter about prototyping it really nicely explains the purpose of prototypes and that even though your first prototype answered your question of “is there a potential in this design” it’s a good idea to create more prototypes which are going to help you answer more questions about uncertain things before you settle on something and go into full production mode great video i think more people should know this stuff,positive
to summarize if you dont make a cheap and fast prototype for your game then your game is an overdeveloped prototype and good luck with that,positive
tldr mark learned to “focus on the primary loop” looks amazing already mark,positive
another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually enjoy game design or not if youre having more fun coming up with the story setting lore and themes than you are experimenting with gameplay ideas then chances are youre more into worldbuilding than game design learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests,positive
hey man ive been building these lets call them prototypes for many years im a programmer and game designer and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days but when it comes to art i just shut down im genuinely awful at the art part so ive always teamed up with artists problem is i then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that its wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect and it suffers as a result eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what weve learned i know this stupid vicious cycle well,negative
now that mark knows how to make games he can take part in the gmtk game jam one of the biggest game jams ever,positive
i’m so grateful that you focused on the “boring stuff” in this video it was very illuminating thanks,positive
here is my feedback i totally got the eureka moments in every level it will be easier to automatically grab de magnet i got softlocked many times so the restart was nice i dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset initially i thought i should return to the key hub that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic ill love to move while aiming it feels more fluent the key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but i dont know how well it fits in the game the doors werent like the key type so it doesnt make sense to open them with it also its kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character for example making the positive smile and the negative sad the main character could shine more while aiming maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim overall i loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so i could try it ,positive
imagine being talented and dedicated enough to not just make a game on your own but also make a high quality video series detailing your design processes at the same time really amazing stuff,positive
and so i abused my internet fame to get someone much smarter than me to build that exact thing i just described fantastic line ,negative
love this series ill admit i was a little sceptical when you changed things on your channel but i am really enjoying this maybe even more than the video essay type videos kutgw 3,positive
► for the next 14 days get 3d art pro for 40 off plus my 2d program totally free ► learn game dev get 25 off with code letsgamedev ► learn 2d art get 25 off with code letsgo ► get my 2d game kit free,positive
i was about to start making my first game my “dream game” glad i saw this and now i’m gonna get a few small games under my belt before my dream game,positive
i started my 2d platformer when i was just starting to learn unity and c i ended up taking a break to make a smaller game a 2d bullet hell shooter called hypershot i put it on steam and i still get a sale now and then now im almost finished my platformer which will be on steam next year,positive
hey glad to see this im about to start making my first game thomas always has the best advice,positive
these are some amazing tips and the one about not doing everything from scratch really made me realize how much time im wasting as for games i worked on a game for most of last year and now that i look back on it i made a lot of mistakes mostly related to planing but i did find out i am much better at programming and designing systems than actually making art plus i learned a lot about the type of games i am mostly good at making,positive
your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me i too pride my self in character building and story telling those are my passions what keeps me making my game this being my first game you’re other tip was perfect i should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story dream game this video hit at the perfect time for me and thank you for your content one question about your stories do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art,positive
i did release my own game on ios about ten years ago it was the only personal project i ever released i outsourced all the creative assets just to save myself time crossing the finish line with this stuff is very challenging i totally agree making your crap game first is the way to go great video,positive
i really enjoy these tip type videos thomas they are really motivating i have my first smallsized project game in mind and it motivated me to not b afraid of using assets if needed thanks for being motivating proud to be part of the gamedev community,positive
cool video i always enjoy seeing game developer improvement over time keep going,positive
bro this is awesome keep up the good work man ik that your work will shine at one point,positive
keep up the good work,positive
awesome stuff,positive
cool video keep making the content its very fun to watch though it does keep me of from doing my homework oh and um… make a game for ios next s,positive
well done,positive
really good video it’s similar to mine but better lol,positive
thanks for the insight,positive
super underrated video and now i got inspired to make a gta clone too,positive
actually underrated,negative
cant wait until the game releases,positive
i love your videos and happened upon then through my recommended feed by showing all of your thought processes going into your designs and wealth of knowledge of architecture your passion made me want to support you and chef rpg through kickstarter i cant wait to see the final product and finally hop into the world you created ,positive
the game has a really nice identity im happy to contribute to it noah manages our project wonderfully and nikita impresses me since the beginning with his pixel art ,positive
i really like the path this game is going towards the world looks and feels alive yet captivatingly out of this world i would love to help you in a way english and turkish are my primary languages so you can reach to me if you need any translation work to turkish in the future since thats all i can do,positive
oooh it is so good to see the new inworld characters sprites also some of the latest decors look soo insane  you and clement did such a great job ,positive
the new character sprites look so good seems like you’ve come so far in such a short amount of time with the amount of detail and complexity in not only the art but the code i assumed you were a seasoned game designer and programmer when i saw your 1st devlog almost 2 years ago i was impressed then and even more so now watching chef rpg progress and improve as you continue to grow as an artist and game developer it’s not only fun but incredibly inspiration for the rest of us indie game dev i can’t wait for the next update,positive
the complexity throughout blows me away theres enough going on in a single indoor restaurant screen to make a fixed screen game out of that instead youre making a game with loads more to explore and do the amount of generosity it takes to make this much content is what i love most and is just as difficult to achieve as making a great game in the first place,positive
omg the new character sprites look fantastic the combination of someone with architectural experience a character artist and a sprite artist sounds very powerful,positive
love the thought that went to this games design and the improvments and overall progress you made thus far really glad i was able to back this project,positive
respect for all your hard work bro the game looks so amazing modern day art,positive
you guys should get a world wide credit for any improvements in the field of cse in upcoming years thank you for giving us these things for free,positive
im only two hours in and i feel like my brain is swelling and going to burst out of my eye sockets ears nose and mouth from all the pure knowledge youre giving me thank you this is the tutorial i was looking for youre actually teaching me the terms and functions and what they mean and not just teaching me how to copy text thank you,positive
this just shows how good youtube can be for teaching several one hour long lessons compressed into a single video for everyone to watch for free no matter where you are,positive
thank you so much this teacher is the best teacher from a tutorial ive ever had clear entertaining and easy to follow well done,positive
for beginners like me this is pure gold bb thanks for posting your vids,positive
i know its corona times but look at all the resources that are available for free what a time to be alive love it,positive
omg you dont know how thankful i am for this tutorial ive been trying to find a tutorial that explains every single thing in a line of code for me for so long thank you so much,positive
very good tutorial even if this tutorial is one year old id like to add something for the inheritance i think it wouldve been worth mentioning the protected accessibility level for variables for those that dont know a protected variable is the same as a private one except that the variable will be treated as if it was public for the child classes its pretty useful in cases like the one shown in this video,positive
7 hours of free content actually teaching you something and for free thank you,positive
i wanted to thank you so much for this tutorial im a total beginner and everything is explained so well and in a pleasant pace also im very thankful for the nice structuring of the video which really helps going back and finding the topics that you need easily thanks a lot for your effort it really is helpful,positive
fantastic game with seemingly endless potential other games in this genre feel outdated in comparison impressive for ea release,positive
3150 i really like the name sapiens that you landed on because that name isnt just prehistoric humans it is a game about sapiens it could be prehistoric medieval modern future or anything because of this you arent stuck with only cavemen it can go as far as you want and the modders want,positive
i’m addicted to this game you gave me the game i’ve wanted for years thank you ,positive
i discovered this project literally a few hours ago and now just minutes ago you upload a video discussing launch i have missed so much but i’m very much looking forward to release,positive
been playing this game for the last week and its brilliant id love to see some sort of interaction with rivers and the terraforming that can be used to create sapienmade canals and such looking forward to the future updates ,positive
your reaction to the release at the end with your family was so fucking wholesome congrats you are living the game dev dream,positive
it’s been an amazing journey to follow absolutely crazy to think i was just 9 when you started work on this— congrats on the early access launch d,positive
been one heck of a ride watching this project for the past few years and finally seeing it come together youve made something really special and i wait to see where you go from here,positive
following the development of sapiens has been a lot of fun i hope the game continues beeeing developed for a long time and really well done making the game its amazing and pushing through past the honeymoon period of the development process,positive
hey everyone instead of the normal devlogs i put together this short summary of how i got into gamedev i hope this is interesting and if you havent already consider subscribing the next video will be a normal devlog again,positive
as a software engineer im doing everything the exact oposite way you are d the code being the easy part and graphics being the hard part you are really artistically talented love to follow your devlogs,positive
super inspiring im about a year and a half into my learning and it makes me feel a lot better about abandoning projects,positive
amazing how much history and experience goes into what looks like a relatively simple game you make it look so easy but it’s so much more than meets the eye,positive
6 years thats incredible loved hearing about how you started think its quite interesting to see how you love for drawingmodelling got you into making games,positive
thats awesome looks like it was a long journey but youve learned a lot im currently on about my 15th overlyambitious doomed project but i hope i can finish something decent soon,positive
i just want to appreciate the amount of effort youve put into making actual projects i often find myself just fiddling around with ideas in my head and not making any project myself i feel that has been a limiting factor in my learning but this video has been super inspirational i have been wanting to make my own devlog series but i was not able to stick to a project long enough till now i have been wanting to make devlogs and work on a small project for a timeline of 3 months and just finish a full game any tips to just stick to it,positive
absolutely loved seeing some of the old insect designs super cool stuff,positive
ive been struggling to get anywhere with my project im glad you havent given up and i love the asthetic and ideas you have for your current project dont give up,positive
your progress over the years is astounding this new game youve been working on looks amazing and is just the sort of game i would love to play i hope you keep at it,positive
quite inspiring story i think most of us would be definitely interested in getting to hear a 2nd part of your journey,positive
as as a games student in my first year of college this has really inspired me to keep pushing myself keep it up mate,positive
congrats,positive
ive just started working at the game industry after studying gamedev too and its amazing that i can see myself in your story although i dont work for a aaa studio but time will tell,positive
im 40 years old just finally starting to getting round to learning programming and unity completely new to it but really enjoy watching these types of videos gives me more motivation ill probably never learn as much as you would have going to uni and stuff but its all fun and learning even if i just make some shitty 2d games thatll be cool haha,positive
ive been working in game dev for 45 years and it seems the best job offers comes not from hrs tech interviewers skill evaluations but the people that just understand what exact people they need in their team and just invite you over at least from my experience in east europe also when comparing your uk collegeuniversity experience to what we have in east europe you are in a intergalactic space age,positive
a friend recommended this video to me to inspire me to work harder on my course in level 3 games design from level 2 i figured itd be quite easy but damn i was mistaken this video has fully inspired me to push more and research more of my course so thank you for this 1 year journey it was very inspiring and keep it up,positive
amazing story makes me regret wasting so much time during collage when i knew i wanted to develop my game dev skills,positive
as a person who is still in school knows no coding language other than html and css very interested in game design favourite game being sea of thieves just mindblowing,positive
you still have clapped british teeth,negative
already 2 years of putting everything together it looks like a proper game good job,positive
wow it has been a journey good job on the 2 years of progress i reckon this game is going to a banger,positive
congratulations on 2 years of game dev awesome progress over the years,positive
man this is so exciting i can’t wait to see what this game will be about i’m also starting my game dev journey and you’re my motivation fuel keep grinding and i hope the best for your future,positive
its amazing how far this project has gone this is really a main inspiration for why i have picked up game development again,positive
i look forward to more game dev content,positive
this game is incredible good work ,positive
this really did have a vibe of a professional youtube video ive really enjoyed the editing style keep rockin in the free world,positive
keep it up bro youll blow up like this i love your humor and editing and also your story is so cool i am excited about your game,positive
along with 200 employees of course lol thats a really good point i just want to tell those who come up like hey so im basically making gta 5 in unity and ill release it on steam next week,positive
fun cheats in bioshock when the player recieves lethal damage he gets a few seconds of god mode leading to more barely survived moments in gears of war the last bullet in a magazine deals 3x damage leading to more barely defended myself moments,negative
coding your own games is easier than you think skip ad,positive
i love how when he was talking about the importance of the players role that when he said just running around doing tasks for the sake of it he showed cod footage,positive
im doing ict in highschool and our teacher showed us this video in class i find game design very interesting and i wish to pursue it in the future i just wanted to thank you for making informative and entertaining content like this youre inspiring people to take up game making,positive
its so great to see you talk about game design i really think you should make a separate video about each one of those themes i see a lot of developers that know how to make games but dont really know how to make them fun and if you can teach them that youll be one step ahead of pretty much every channel like yours,positive
great video it may be overwhelming for someone just starting out but actually you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these but mentioning important aspects of each for example the part of rules and the events in the game was great and even though it seems obvious i never thought about that i dont make games myself though but i find game making incredibly interesting and difficult,positive
thank you brackeys ive had so much trouble with designing my own games thanks for sharing your knowledge with everyone,positive
you give great tips and info that are worth so much more than the time you spend making them please keep up the great work and we will all keep watching,positive
the first game is wonder and so well polished imagine if it was released in 90s it wouldve wiped the market,positive
all these games seem pretty good but the first is definitely my favourite the second game looks nice enough however the gameplay looks rather bland,positive
the first game is awesome the second one just did what you wanted him to but nothing more the third one was quite cool but a bit boring also is horror game material the fourth game looked like if it was made by a 10 year old but still cool,positive
based on their fiverr pages the first game appears to have cost 25 the second 35 third 5 and last one is listed at 30 i would have to say 1 was easily the best investment,positive
the first game could end up being successful with proper funding and development i love the idea of the recoil that launches you imagine that they added bosses multiplayer etc,positive
the first one definitely felt more varied and had more to it compared to the others which they did do what they were requested but the other 3 just lookedgeneric in a way while the first had enemies with ai that would attack you interesting level design and the movement and gunplay had more personality to thembeing able to move the gun in any direction using recoil to jumplift off the ground as well as different types of guns to play with i guess it just had more polish to it compared to the others too,positive
the developer of the first game is sick  great game,positive
the first game was a really clever reference to no time to explain with very similar mechanics and pretty much the same genre,positive
been in game development at least 14yrs now i literally lost track greatest advice given here is to target a niche and do something special platformers and zombie games are a dime a dozen pick out something unique thats cool maybe something that no one has done in many years thats how stardew valley blew up on steam,positive
tip 1 can’t be stressed enough i spent my first year learning courses on coursera and udemy thinking i’d get into game design once i’m “ready” that day never came no matter what i learned i never felt ready yet then one day i just started working on my project and said i’d learn new things where i needed to honestly doing things this way made me progress faster than any course ever has,positive
not sure if its mentioned in this video but something i feel should be said in every tips video like this dont do your dream project first you will ruin it if you dont give up first,negative
the tip i see missing from all of these videos is take inspiration from wide sources not just your favorite games whats the good in the game you otherwise hate what do you like about that book you just read how can you incorporate colour like they do in that movie you watched this is what they mean when they say good artists copy great artists steal when you steal something you make it your own and if you steal from a diverse set of inspirations it becomes truly yours,negative
you didnt waste those 2 years you learned so much you did so many things these things add up in the future we think we can learn everything in yt videos but experiencing it firsthand gives you a much deeper understanding of things,positive
shaders were super intimidating but i spent a weekend learning them and am so glad i did it i feel pretty fluent in them not even a week later and have been using them nonstop i needed to use them for one effect but the applications where shaders are useful keep appearing it’s definitely a tool worth having in your arsenal and like visual scripting vs actual coding being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldn’t be able to do with visual scripting a shader,positive
imo something thats extremely underrated especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on observer pattern is a must for game dev with larger projects having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects and it makes your code more modular each classgame object is its own self contained thing singleton and factory patterns as well as solid principles are also good to look into factory less so for unity since you can use getcomponent to retrieve references for things if youre using unity learn to use unity eventsc events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects,positive
i am still alive lol its going to take some more time but more devlogs will actually be coming also thanks for the crazy amount of support it means a lot,positive
ive watched this video a bunch of times it really is so good only just realised i wasnt subbed,positive
i would actually play this game for hours keep going,positive
actually i have a plenty good options for the game those options are player has 200 health points the turret has a field of view ai if it sees the player itll shoot health and power pickups airborne aerial targets such as drones heavy gunner drones scout drones etc ground targets such as beamshooting mechs enemy balls similar to the player but a little bit dumb and laser artilleries the tank can destroy the turret since the tank has the same weapons as the turret but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank grenadetype weapons and projectiles i meant by that which has new weapons to choose such as fullauto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire or just a singleshot grenade launcher similar to the m79 the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup the player can shut down the turrets system i hope this guy would see this,positive
1011 that looks so fun even though the movement is basic id love to fight that,positive
legion makes incredible game meoh boy can’t wait to pl legion doesn’t make a link to get this master piece,positive
loved watching this i’m glad i stumbled upon this on youtube world i watched this with my 11yr son and i see he loved it as well then we clicked to watch more videos and to our sad surprise you only had this video  hope you kept at it and will put out more videos you can earn a nice living on youtube as well,positive
i love the high quality of this series and how the team behind it is willing to give away more prize money than any other competition game show edit wow thanks for the likes,positive
bro is giving away more than my entire net worth,negative
i have been getting into game dev in the past year and really enjoy it and you are a big inspiration thank you,positive
fun game excellent for 24 hours seizure bug warning dont dash right in the code input room though you can break the game and if you keep dashing around you can cause the screen to start flashing enough to trigger seizures,positive
i think the post processing added a lot of style to game made me realise the importance of post processing nice job great video,positive
yoo this is actually a good game just gave it a try the concept is great,positive
vimlark does a game engine run on gas me no it runs on human suffering,negative
as someone who’s interested in becoming a game dev this is really inspiring,positive
that’s it this is the last thing i really needed i’m going to start my vr dev journey thankyou for the inspiration,positive
you had me at i have anxiety to the point where i almost didnt go in even when i was sitting in the parking lot man do i know that feeling now try it with shortterm amnesia,negative
642 anxiety to the point where i was considering not going to this meetup even when i was sitting in the parking lot of the venue i felt that hard good job making it happen,negative
i know i might sound like a dreamer but i really want to make a historical medieval first person hack and slash game with total war commands like mordhau and bannerlord i know it’s a huge stretch but that’s the end goal hopefully some day i’ll get there,positive
this is one of the most inspiring videos ive ever watched thank you so much for this im new to the game design space and one of my biggest hurdles has been feeling overwhelmed about my lack of coding experience seeing your journey of how you went from no coding experience to being able to code a game by yourself at your first game jam really did something for me,positive
as a gamedev who uses construct 3 this is really inspiring,positive
this is lovely to hear how you found a whole community and amazing that you spent so long persistently making stuff especially over a year of daily art i just discovered core but didn’t realise it’s a creation tool i haven’t loaded it up yet and they described it more as an arcade full of games i’ve had an idea for a cat game for ages since i got three kittens last year and they’re hilarious i don’t suppose there’s a basic cat model to edit i draw and paint some but the oomph goes too easily i just got back into gaming after a while and you saying ‘i was a bored artist’ resonated i’ve been wanting to do more with characters i was writing a story for too heck i even learned code a few years ago but my passion for websites waned and i found i didn’t love battling all my errors enough to keep going so this all seems fun ,positive
the new dont explode looks so much better already even you have came a long way with pixel art and animation youre doing a great job ,positive
very inspiring for my own journey of learning unity so far ive been working on my own first project for 125 days,positive
your one of the best coders one youtube thanks for helping me on my journey,positive
hello i have been tremendously enjoying your devblog videos i can’t wait to see the next i do have a question how are you creating your buildings within your world i just started creating my own top down game with tilemaps and have encountered numerous issues creating buildings with tilemaps i noticed that in the beginning of this video you are making buildings with the tiles that looks like a different program are you having better success utilizing that method of creating your world,positive
i love the idea of this its a great way to see your progress when you usually dont see it,positive
cool  i hope you can do this full time someday,positive
awesome d,positive
nice video very inspiring and also handsome face,positive
this motivates me,positive
thanks so much for watchin guys and all your support ► remember you can get 40 off 3d art pro plus 2d art pro free,positive
ive experienced a fair amount of these mutations myself and i love the way you were able to convey your journey through the video i especially loved the bit about now youre the pizza guy the major trap is where i find my identity good stuff thomas keep it up,positive
i really appreciate thought process videos pressing buttons on the mouse and keyboard isnt the difficult thing getting into the right mindset is the real beast thanks for this,positive
thanks for sharing all this thomas its good to be aware of some of these pitfalls btw they also apply for things outside game development,positive
i absolutely love of how you show the dark side of gamedev too and not just make all theese videos about how to make your game great it always makes it more relatable and helps with motivation for me keep up the great work,positive
thanks thomas for being so transparent in your journey as a gamedev you level the playing field by showing us that the grass is not always greener on the other side you expose the struggles and show us encouraging ways to conquer the challenges along the way,positive
completely agree with your points in mutation 1 i am twice as good at codingdeveloping as i was last month and i have the urge to go back and fix things that i no longer deem worthy however i got to the point where i realized that just because i am better at in my craft doesnt mean that my old features are bad sometimes simplicity is key i think its about finding the right balance  thank you again for sharing your insights thomas ,positive
i found myself in several of those steps and i was already working on solutions for each of those well done thomas for putting those feelings into words so clearly,positive
dude i absolutely love the course and thanks for including the 2d art pro for free also thanks for being so inspiring and encouraging youve learned where the sweet spot is for making games and hit it every time you seek to educate thanks again,positive
the same goes for all the careers and fields there are always pros and cons a riskfree life is the most dull and boring life,negative
me show this to my parents my parents wowyou should work hard like him and become a doctor,positive
super inspiring video theres also a huge misconception about pc spec for game dev or 3d i mean 2010 intel hd graphics will do for start no need to go rtx at day 1 literally,positive
thats a beautifull story bro congrats,positive
coding is what got me through the lockdownlockdownskeeps the mind constantly occupied,positive
i love how you stuck to your responsibilities while still going after your dream freaking inspiring man,positive
david i didnt even know how to program still dont me as a programmer story of my life,negative
my dev friend asked me to write story for his game im so stoked ive been dying to get into writing for games were working on an indie game now and this video is everything i need,positive
not gonna lie i had tears in my eyes what a wonderful story subscribed,positive
im in the position starting out in film as well im very excited to embark on the game dev journey,positive
tip 26 make sure to like subscribe for more awesome game dev videos okayso maybe that was less of a tip and more of a suggestion,positive
454 totally agree with writing readable code i just dont think and are the problem at all in my opinion if someone sees that as hard to read they should probably take a step back i think badinconsistent indentation confusing variable names repeated code and organization in general are way greater problems that beginner coders do very often,negative
these were lessons i had to learn the hard way over my four years of development thanks for getting this crucial tips out there for people starting out,positive
my unofficial tip 26 comment your code it makes it so much easier to fix bugs or change things when you can see what pieces of code serve which purposes,positive
great vid on the controversial tip i agree keep your code readable but id argue this is more about naming properties and functions and not cramming too much on one line replacing variable with variable false leans towards being overly verbose to me i would read variable as not variable personally but whatever makes it easier for you to understand your own code when coming back to it,positive
on that readable code tip 24 id refine that to say make sure you can read your own code in a game im currently working on ive added some variables that i could very easily get away without using the only reason i have them is because they make my code cleaner and easier to work with also make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line it is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary to that end i will create empty methods if thats how my model works,positive
507 never ever do this if boolean false is horrible form if an exclamation mark is really too difficult then just use the not keyword but please dont abuse comparison operators like that,negative
these are great im working on my ansi ascii roguelike and i keep getting caught up in tiny details like changing the color of the player and enemies when theyre frozen or poisoned and tweaking the ui,positive
start your free trial on gamemaker studio 2 here thank you guys for watching the video,positive
the fact that the second game developer was paid less than minimum wage is upsetting none of the artists were credited as well such a shame,negative
the first game felt like a flash game the second felt like a full release and the third felt like one of those unity games with fun physics overall the thumbnail was not only clickbait but those 3 poor devs were definitely heavily underpaid for their work i dont think i would be happy only giving them so little money for their work and not even giving them credit either,negative
second one was definitely the best honestly with a few updates to design ui and the background this could be a top tier mobile game the background could change to a crystal cavern at a higher lvl and the enemies could change later lvls,positive
opening blender for the first time is terrifying wheres the make finished 3d model button,negative
i actually loled a few times watching this you perfectly described a persons first experiences with game dev and unity pretty well most peoples are worse than your experience because they have no programming experience and dont understand anything going on at all ,negative
you are very underrated your editing and game development skills are amazing when i watched ur video i have not looked at ur sub count and ii honestly though o was watching a channel that had over 100k subs if u keep this up you will get to 1 million subs in no time,positive
thats prob the best dev log i ever seen  i see so much effort put into just one video like this one ,positive
you really know how to edit and create games hope you continue youtube you are very under rated,positive
congrats man you are going places great editing and content got a new subscriber ,positive
underrated youtuber i really like this editing style and it never gets boring,positive
hahaha great stuff i lost it when you coded coroutine for the enemy death instead of doing it properly which is not that hard such a nice workaround good job d,positive
► for the next 14 days get 3d art pro for 40 off plus my 2d program totally free ► learn game dev get 25 off with code letsgamedev ► learn 2d art get 25 off with code letsgo ► get my 2d game kit free,positive
step 0 just start doing it and dont put it off most of this stuff is free like unity blender and audacity no reason to wait,positive
for all the new indie devs use which ever game engine you feel comfortable with unity godot gamemaker and yes unreal be persistent and make lots of games can make your dream game or side project,positive
i use unity every day and its great its like an allrounder game engine unreal is more of a 3d artistfocused engine so choose unity if youre more of a programmer and want to make crossplatform and various games choose unreal if you only want to make 3d games and youre more of an artist if youre still not sure just go with unity,positive
hi thomas brush im brad fry and i work as a self employed flooring and installer and want to make games for a living haha your intro inspired me to write that but all jokes aside im 37 and have 4 kids and my own business well solo contractor your videos have really given me the feeling i could at least learn to develop games despite the limited time keep up the good work,positive
thomas is back to the old content i’m overwhelmed with nostalgia ,positive
hey all most of the models used in the vid were created by synty studios they found my channel and reached out as a potential sponsor as i love using their assets it was an easy yes so if you want to get any synty assets for yourself check out my affiliate link to support the channel,positive
i thought this video was very professionally made i was surprised when i got to the end and saw your subscriber count you definitely deserve more great work on some really good looking games,positive
ive watched a few how i started game dev my game dev xx year journey vids and this is by far the best one not the funniest one but definitely the most humble straight forward and informative,positive
you got me in the first minute “not seeing friends i don’t have” and “looking at unity no idea what i was looking at” exactly my feeling,negative
the quality of what you achieved so far is amazing tourney manager gave me tons of mount blade vibes,positive
this is pretty insightful and inspiring also great progress keep it up,positive
proud of your journey man it takes a great deal of discipline to start something new and stick it out i think i bought your latest project tavern master on steam a couple months ago and i thought it was pretty decent keep at it only upwards from here,positive
the production quality of this video is too high for the amount of subscribers you have this channel will grow exponentially if you keep this up great work and very inspirational stuff,positive
hello from a fellow dev you have done so much in those two years ive been at this for 4 years and feel like ive done less even though i have a game already out there in open beta excellent video quality editting very promising youtube channel,positive
this is inspiring i wish i had kept up my momentum with learning unity subbed now ill binge the rest of your content,positive
when i was 14 and thought of developing my own game i was so overwhelmed by the code i ended up quitting you are so talented i’m gonna stick to playing video games lmao,positive
the fact you even thought the robot saw himself as the hero for fighting pollution is really mesmerizing probably a kind of game id be interested if released on steam great evolution in your projects btw,positive
great job accomplishing so much when you were so young its great to see how many different genres you tried too would love to see what you are working on currently,positive
wow most of your games can be combined into one huge game just imagine a bunny shooting while on top on a plane,positive
damn you were one hell of a 14 year old developer,negative
you can really tell the progress awesome especially the logic behind the last one with the cars its something that can get you in a tesla like company to code the actual self driving cars so keep up the good work,positive
i’d love to see a multiplayer fps remake,positive
damn this is actually insanely cool even the really simple ones are really interesting,positive
this inspired me to look into making games the coding looks so intense though is it difficult,positive
make sure to smash that subscribe button for games wings and better special effects than the last airbender movie what special effects do you want to see next,positive
im glad you didnt show yourself eating salads and drinking starbucks 90 of the time but actually showed your work great content subbed,positive
working on your job working on your own dreamsmanaging a youtube channel and spending time with the family mad respect bro definitely got my sub,positive
found the channel today through reddit admirable to see people who do full time work and find discipline and will to work on something else like a game on the side also how can i horizontally center a div is a classic haha,positive
dude its amazing how much you were able to balance so many things in your daily life i envy it,positive
thats awesome man i wish you the best of luck for your games im still young but i really wanna be a game designer when ill be older so watching that kind of videos gives me more hope to achieve what i want,positive
love seeing people do what they really enjoyed doing thumbs up,positive
once again amazing stuff i’m proud and confident to say that i’m here before you blow up well edited well paced and well shot even with a meh camera i know you’re going to succeed keep at it,positive
this was super refreshing to watch thanks for this i work in retail and i’m currently working on a fighter and i recently got all 6 of my characters working i’m glad game dev is just fun for you cheers,positive
this dude has a dream setup but then a family reunion lawn chair thats the definition of i can do what i want,positive
yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making 2d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make 2d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to 3d games by learning 3d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with 3d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already,negative
can we appreciate how he made 3 functional games in 7 days with one being vr,positive
this video taught me to spend way too much time on ragdolls when making a 3d game,negative
this guys humour is a gift to humanity,positive
me this will be fun 1hr later why isnt the camera rotating,positive
its crazy how inspiring and good this guy is a game maker is born if i had the option i would put your game game of the year or decade ,positive
the first talk was great solo developers can get caught up following professional project management methods but forget the factor of individual motivation eg it might be faster to first deal with the most complex problem but making small wins working on art or marketing along the way helps you to stay motivated,positive
was amazing to be involved in this hopefully you all can get some good nuggets out of it along with being more prepared for the hidden pitfalls,positive
the talks were good but their personal reflections were amazing we really put these guys on a pedestal but we tend to ignore the emotional impact of solo development the gratification when the project is finished is amazing but the journey there definitely seems like a rollercoaster,positive
independent developers should bookmark this cursed problems in game design also hosted by gdc 2 of the best imo,positive
i had my second project planned before releasing the first game which helped me skip that depressing stage after releasing theres really no happiness at the end of the road no matter how many sales you make so gotta enjoy the adventure and hop on the next one right away,positive
such a great and relevant session each of the panelists had a ton of valuable insights to offer thank you,positive
im absolutely stunned how much emotional i got with this speeches kind of like in the last public question im also doing a board game and im happy to hear that games take extremely long to port and that it is a rollercoaster of emotions and full of pitfalls to watch out for but as long as i keep looking back at my younger self who started my streamers ace project i cant make him sad and quit thanks for that amazing talk and all your effort you all put into it,positive
i love how they all highlight different spectrum of solo development,positive
i have to ask how do you line up the monitor camera transitions so well xd is it really just holding the camera precariously at an angle that lines up the monitor bezels and then moving it out so well done,positive
as a dev i liked that small insight into the code and class implementations would be up to see more of that in future,positive
you motivated me to start being more orderly to have plants and to eat healthier i really like your routine and im trying to improve mine as well soon i will also enter patreot i really appreciate what you are doing,positive
i love these calm relaxing devlogs keep it up dd,positive
i feel like enjoying your healthy daily routine more than the coding part xd i like how you mix designing modeling coding and life style content in your dev logs great content,positive
your videos are such a treat to watch always excited when a new one is posted keep up the good work the game is really coming along nicely,positive
this game feels way better to me now that youve chilled out the tool usage a really good and subtle change to the vibe,positive
your meals look divine  the game is progressing nicely,positive
great update love your focus on the little details that ensure this game will be a relaxing experience for players on an unrelated note i look forward to the day when i can eat dinner without my puppy needing to go in the crate p,positive
bro i am so glad i discovered your channel these videos are gem not only entertaining but they also highly motivate me to start with unreal engine thanks,positive
your channel is such an inspiration to us slow methodical developers struggling to finish overcomplicated projects to try new things,positive
wow you have 6 videos and managed to gain over 100k subscribers that is truly impressive and shows how good your content is,positive
i would love a multiplayer classic doom type of game that would be dope,positive
it was quite funny bro loved it also got some level design ideas for my very first game thank you so much,positive
hell yeah dude although i would recommend it gets exposure and be free for sometime the reason is well you re a small dev and you gotta gain a following and give good feedback to your customers and its an initial experimental stage,positive
hey just wondering did you use the default sessions for the multiplayer or some other plugin would be handy to know because the default sessions i think are only lan and loopback and ive tried that steam plugin but that doesnt work out great also good video,negative
go to and use code hmw to get 15 off clickups massive unlimited plan for a year start reclaiming your time for less than 5 a month hurry offer ends soon,positive
microtransactions are really soiling the gaming experience imo everything is quickly becoming a subscription,negative
save you 14 minutes games as a service are vastly more profitable than the initial revenue from games,positive
the reason triple aaa games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design theyre treating what were supposed to be enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly you cant just create another gta v every single year that shit takes a lot of time,negative
another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control business just wont allow that much money to be spent on an experiment everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey uncreative bland games that look really nice,negative
when some people say games from older generations were better i must agree as a kid i imagined how insane the games would look like with so much more options to buy and play with even better graphics and physics but sadly nowadays most titles are just cash grabs and the fun part is ignored its hard to find triple a titles with good and fun gameplay without only pay2win features thats why im revisiting emulation indie games and a few aaa titles which are worth the money and also the playtime,positive
ive been telling my friends this for the past couple years we are going to see fewer aaa games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the preexisting games as well there is just so much competition in this industry,negative
it’s awful sad to see how stuff goes to thrash when the general public gets access look at youtube itself with its mandatory “ad friendly content” social media taking over everything lack of variety due to companies milking “winning formulas” dry game companies noticing that the casual player is not demanding quality at all… it sucks,negative
i remember freshman year when you would be working on your games in class cool to see how far you’ve come with it,positive
i hope one day to be able to look back at your progress as greatly as you have been able super hyped for the release,positive
the journey from not understanding what an if statement is to having a complete game is always awe inspiring to look back on hopefully well see some cool projects in unreal engine at somepoint,positive
great video its awesome how far youve come and to see such a positive attitude with game dev keeping things realistic is always best,positive
great vid man was nice to see how your game dev journey began good luck on the next project,positive
even though i just got a recommendation from this channel i am proud of your pursuit for your passions,positive
super happy to see how far you’ve come being your friend getting to come over and see your progress has always been so much fun can’t wait to keep seeing your progress,positive
just keep trying to improve everyday words to live by,positive
hey i recently discovered your channel and i just wanna say im practicing many things that i am passionate about and your channel is a big inspiration just hope you know youre making good influences,positive
dude the algorithm has blessed me with this wonderful video 1010 you earned a new sub,positive
woah ive never met somebody so underrated your sense of humour is immaculate mixed with politeness and a good amount of jokes the way you explain everything so crisply and manage to fit it all in in just a 10minute long video is surprising keep up the good content o,positive
dani is literally the reason ive started game dev he might not realize this but hes inspired alot of people including me and karlson is literally my dream gamemainly because i grew up playing mirrors edge and other parkour games,positive
underrated i agree he’s extremely good at game development but he also has millions of subscribers millions more viewers and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm not to mention karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions and one of the most wishlisted games on steam many other solo gamedevs out there who pour just as much if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what i’d call underrated there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like dani i’m not saying it’s his fault or anything i watch him and support him i’m just saying the claim that he’s underrated let alone the most underrated is incredibly wrong as far as i’m concerned,positive
he ain’t overrated not underrated he’s a extremely brilliant developer who is wellrated,positive
at first i thought this was going to be a bad retelling of danis history video but instead it talked about things after that and indepth telling of crab game and muck that was pretty entertaining keep doing what youre doing in a few years you will with no doubt have 1 million if you keep it up,positive
good video wouldnt agree with the title though since well hes one of the most popular indie devs out there with an audience of over 3 million on youtube and the 2 free games he put on steam being orders of magnitude bigger than even successful games but hey titles are titles it didnt really get driven on particularly much in the video,positive
such amazing content creator definitely needs more support you earned a subscriber hoping for more nice content,positive
that desk would’ve taken me at least 3 days to draw,negative
this is one of my fav videos from you lately i loved seeing more of your late development process i’ll be building my gaming pc soon aswell so i’m really hype for the launch of “monster tower” lmao,positive
nice video reece im always impressed by the cool and unique videos ideas you think of,positive
this game looks fkng great i love those kinds of games like go and explore by yourself no one will stop u and says hey go here and here,positive
awesome way to beat procrastination d im barely even keeping a todo list with my current project i have a list with 5 tasks 3 are done lol hopefully this will inspire me to be more organized because it will speed up my development 200 youve inspired me as always reece and ive only been awake 15 mins d,positive
hey reece this is a really cool and unique video idea and great execution love the insights and entertainment i got here since i could also totally relate to all the time consuming tasks of game dev usually i calculate for everything 23x the time i write down because it usually takes longer and unexpected things start to happen always,positive
that was anticlimactic love the video though great idea to challenge yourself and get yourself motivated again,positive
its so hard not to crunch during game dev big ups for this,positive
the game is looking great really interesting challenge too since you drew i suggest a rematch to find a true winner,positive
im just finishing up a computer science degree and i really want to get into video game development i play indie games almost constantly and i love the idea of making something of my own that i myself and other people can enjoy but i keep holding myself back because im scared and dont know where to start this video was definitely helpful and inspiring to me and it makes me feel like i actually have a shot at gaining the skills i need and making something cool,positive
hi great video really gave some helpful insights im currently in university studying computer science as every single company in my city said its a requirement but im also going to be working on my own projects hopefully i can skip the stage of being employed and start my own company we can dream haha but yeah this has been helpful the information was concise and well presented good job and thank you,positive
my dream since i was like 12 is to work for rockstar i hope i get there one day,positive
these videos are really helpful i watch them with my friends on voicely whenever we practice coding we all agree that we learned more from youtube videos than from school lol,positive
bro i just learned that the college im planning on attending next year also has japanese courses which ive wanted to do since middle school combining that with game development could lead me to working for a japanese developer like fromsoftware,positive
thanks to ricch dawg for being there for me when i truly needed strong support you made this degree happen for me by arranging digit credit card info for me to be able to do the payment have been struggling for ,positive
hi there this was a great video that has told me exactly what i need to know could you recommend some groupscommunities that accept someone with no experience at all i have a physical version of my game and i know the rules inside and out i have learnt how to draw digitally and am transferring the art into a format that can be used in the game i want to make and a community that is welcoming and that gives feedbackadvie would be awesome,positive
bruh i write how to make a game engine and get a fucking adventure video,negative
unreal engine left the chat,negative
pretty brave of unity to sponsor their 1 competitor great stuff,positive
just imagine how cool a game engine jam would be,positive
really like the editing can def tell a lot of effort was put in,positive
the simple idea of making a game engine from scratch is just too impressive for my tiny brain to comprehend,positive
yo this video is so good my guy i love how you used after effects for the entire editing process but for real incredible work glad to have my face featured also ,positive
you could give him a revolver that shoots but in a limited range similar to the swords range cool video btw,positive
i feel like the older model could still work fine if you made him look more closely to a blob around the face area and just had a bigger emphasis around the face,positive
cant wait to see how it turns out looks sick so far  ,positive
look into how nuclear throne does attack animations it simply teleports the sword from one side of the player to the other while creating a separate slash object which slowly dissipates i’ve used this technique in my current roguelike and it works amazingly well,positive
i’ve always wanted to make a game and i’ve come up with many ideas for it but i’ve never been committed enough to actually learn game development glad to see you pulling through and learning it keep up the great work also what if for a 2 hit floating sword combo you swing it overhead for the first hit and for the second attack the sword flings out and spins in a circle,positive
i always tend to make my main characters cute and small it makes it easier for the players to get attached to them so as far as audience feedback goes at least one dude likes the new design as for animations with floating hands most of my characters have floating hands like yours but mainly use ranged weapons limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off so dont be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it if youre not too attached to the melee combat why not focus on ranged instead kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side,positive
my name is len thanks for building an island for me,positive
the artwork looks absolutely fantastic that is a huuuge selling point for a game like this people that like really chill games will love that if the dungeons are cool enough for players who like a good diablo grind youll have a game that appeals to a huge variety of players,positive
yoo thanks for this it teaches soo much im a noob and have a dream and idea of eventually creating my own game if it takes me 10yrs and only my friends play it doesnt matter i will do it,positive
hi julian i love your game so far and am obsessed with the art style of it all i am from california with a bachelors degree in english and wanted to see if you needed a writer to develop the world lore or whatever storycampaignquestsdialogue you want to bring into lens island i dont have a portfolio since i am just starting to reach out to developers for my first opportunity to write for someone but would love to connect to maybe write a test piece for you and if you like it then we could look into working together i will write anything and everything for your game free for a full year and will sign an nda to protect your work either way i wish you all the best and thank you for your time logan,positive
been following this project for ages and im always blown away by the attention to detail in the level design super excited to see where the game goes from here,positive
seems like a pretty large scope to launch this december,positive
the game is looking awesome when i first saw your videos about your studentprojectgame and your new project it motivated me to work harder and now i am in gamedesign school myself thank you a lot for the motivation however i think it might be good to add some impact to trees and rocks when hit like a little shake as of right now the only indication you hit the rocktree is the popup text and that is not really satisfying not that its bad the way it is right now just as feedback,positive
its so aesthetic definitely my favourite aspect is the versatility one has when playing if one didnt want to dungeon crawl they could create amazing buildings etc and vice versa,positive
love the video goodgis having used bfxr in the past im gonna check out labchirp now xd here are a few i didnt see in the video but i think are worth a mention graphicsgale pixel art krita foss raster art sunvox music tracker petaporon simple piano roll sequencer famistudio chiptune music famitracker chiptune music tracker chiptone sound effects,positive
the one thing i think you really missed here in the raster editing section is krita which is especially useful for creating tiling textures as well as having a really powerful painting workflow,positive
for 2d art i personally use krita its free and pretty neat its good with animation too,positive
really well put together video loved the editing as always and i feel that the topic you picked up on today is one that not many people do touch upon but is incredibly essential i know ive been developing games for over 3 years now and over one year with unity really important topic and you grabbed it and gave a perfect video as always good job ps almost to 30k,positive
i would just like to say that audio software wise you have saved me so much research thank you for making this video and keep up the great work,positive
i know that you cant get into it in a short video but the political philosophy behind foss is fascinating in many ways foss or at least its driving philosophies predate proprietary software,positive
247 actually all unity tools are available in the free version you only need to pay when you exceed 100000 dollars per year there are no limits,positive
i like a and c b may be good for caves,positive
press m to merge two or more points in blender its rly useful also nice vid d,positive
this is awesome ive been working on mine for nearly two years now its crazy difficult to keep motivated but i always found myself coming back to get work done my game releases next month and i cant wait youve been doing it longer though i respect you for the sheer amount of motivation youve had to keep up and for starting a project this big,positive
this game has come a very long way and is looking amazing good job so far me too is working on a 3d survival game and it is quite fun,positive
those models look great i love the style also a fan of the editing,positive
this looks awesome man i love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool keep up the good work and thanks for the video,positive
the progress is looking super awesome and impressive also spending 3 years behind a single project shows dedication really like the features that you showed here especially where the one where the base starts flying for the enemies a b and c i actually like all of them you could use all three and give different functionality to them like one of them are predator and hunts the other two and the player 045 you could use blenders merge by distance to merge the vertex i just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one saves lot of time keep it up,positive
the game looks great i love the models also the video editing skills are great d i wish i could make even one 3d model lol x i subscribed,positive
its really bold of you to ditch the safety of your masters degree to pursue your indie dev career truly inspiring and thanks for sharing your stats i hope more indie devs do their sales overview it helps aspiring game devs like me to gauge whats realistic and whats not when it comes to running a oneman studio,positive
dude thats awesome also making a game every 3 months aint so bad youre officially in the business now i cant wait to one day join the rest of you,positive
1 to engagement metrics also after a year of it being up it would be cool to do a follow up video to see the life span of the game,positive
i appreciate you explaining the logistics of game development it simply is something done out of passion,positive
i usually dont leave good comments but youre a pretty funny guy good personality and its a shame that somebody so smart made very little on a really cool game like that i hope it becomes much more successful shout out to all the underdog nerds out there who dont get what they truly deserve,positive
the video was engaging and entertaining i think continuing this level of quality regardless of topic is probably gonna get your channel to some serious viewership in the future you seriously deserve more subs than what you have just keep doing what you’re doing thanks for the video,positive
dude thats awesome its a lot of money dont knock yourself down over it its nice seeing a small indie dev become successful,positive
the amount of hardwork you put in your video i cant say you are amazing,positive
i love how transparent and motivating you are keep it up im supporting u ,positive
subscribe  also follow me on twitch,positive
a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible im very exited to see this games future so good luck,positive
an idea for the rock skins maybe you can make them the gemstones in the cave and make them unlockable by interacting with the gemstones down there sounds pretty neat,positive
218 to be honest man this was actually pretty good it has a nice friendly yet also slightly cursed in a good way feeling to it,positive
personally i think adding a way for the seekers to set bananas as traps that would show the location of a hider that triggers it might be cool,positive
wonderful and fantastic tutorial its really helpful the explanation is so clear thumb up to the tutor,positive
loved the videoits very informative and insightful under 8 mins quiz answers 1st and 2nd are supervised while 3rd is unsupervised,positive

the explanation is fantastic thank you for your work,positive
im so happy that you started giving courses on machine learning i appreciate your clear teaching style,positive
words are not enough to appreciate what you present in your channel i do believe you are number one in programming,positive
for info 1 at 3252 to avoid userwarning x does not have valid feature names we need to train the model with the values of inputdataset ie use xvalues instead of x in modelfitxvalues y 2 4204 joblib is now a seperate py package we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearnexternals anyway thanks mosh for another great tutorial,positive
finally i found something practical rather than theoretical thank you sir,positive
mister mosh thank you for all of the easy to follow tutorials that you make for us please keep keep up the good work i hope you post more courses preferably in python,positive
im so glad i stumbled upon this you are amazing this was very pleasant and easy to follow i learned a ton and i especially like that you took us through your thought process while examining the music data set too thank you very much subscribed,positive
you are the reason why i started programming ill never forget the things youve done to help me,positive
thank you so much very clear and neat explanation i hope you will continue diving deeper into detailed concepts rather than concentrating only on basics your way of explanation plus the details would be the great video for all i think,positive
amazing tutorial you explained everything so clearly and helped me to grasp some of the topics even better,positive
hey mosh your contents and teaching style are straightforward and easy to follow it would be great help if you do some tutorials based on medical imaging ctmri data i am having difficulties in dealing with those thank you,positive

having done machine learning in the past year this was actually a really good revision,positive
perfect example of age doesnt matter if you have knowledge 3 nicely done bro,positive
this course is the best i’ve ever seenheard explaining the concepts of machine learningdeep learning just simply awesome mit students are really lucky to have this professor makes me wish to be a college student again,positive
sir good evening i am not related to this subject but your way of explaining subject matter is excellent you are lecturer from top most institute in the world so i love to watch way of teaching process methods and dealing with subject topicsyour attitude and way of dealing contents is very simplecongratulations sir,positive
i thank mit for uploading such a valuable videos to the world will definitely make a donation to mit after i got my dream job i can listen to this teacher 100 hours continuously the way he spread words and his character,positive
this is god level content wow i want to salute this man for explaining complex ideas in such simple terms no wonder mit grads learn so well i can only wish,positive
i dont always like his sense of humor but this is an excellent lecture by professor eric grimson,positive
this is how you teach students awesome explanations without the explanation of the fundamental terminologies as he is doing here machine learning becomes boring to learn,negative
i think that eric is a tremendous teacher really enjoy watching him explain stuff,positive
what an amazing video so easy to understand thank you so much,positive
i can listen to this teacher 100 hours continuously the way he spread words and his character,positive
i thank mit for uploading such a valuable videos to the world,positive
regards awesome explanation,positive
as a person who has selflearned a bit of python and is just trying to learn this stuff this is exactly the best place to begin,positive
one “like” is not enough for the work that has gone into making one such video this video should be part of the curriculum and he should get the royalty for this awesome work,positive
this video kickstarted my journey in ml a year back trust me back then i watched this video three times to finally understand it might be challenging for few to get it but when you get it it just feels amazing,positive
im in my first year of engineering looking to go into cs and this video makes me extremely excited for my coming education ive already watched so many of your videos and theyve all had a similar effect thank you so much,positive
i am just astounded i spent so much time trying to understand this concept everywhere i looked people would show the similar neural network animation but no one ever really explained and exemplified every single step layer term and mathematics behind it the video is really well structured and with amazing animations extremely well done my mind is so blown i can barely write this comment,positive
i am programming for more than ten years and i never saw anyone explain a complex idea by such a clean and clear terms well done,positive
thank you so much for the visualizations i think if math teachers always refer to how it pictorially looks the intuition would be easier to get this is why you and dr strang from mit have good content,positive
finally ml thank you so much i would be interested in a beyond 100sec or more short vids in this topic keep it up ,positive
you know every time i want to learn some new framework or language i come here for your 100 seconds series every time you manage to explain whats important about a topic in barely 2 minutes which drives people like me to want to learn more love your vids editing today was  as always,positive
i still dont get how you can push out so much content with high quality so oftenquickly well done once again ,positive
i love the little bits of humour that you inject into the images without acknowledging them in your audio so good ,positive
finally i can add machine learning specialist to my portfolio,positive
finally the best explanation of ml in 100 seconds has landed on earth  this is possible only with fireship ,positive
definitely more machine learning content on this channel id love to dive into it with your help,positive
i would love some more content on machine learning great video as always,positive
i love this content and the concise nature in which its delivered,positive
she is such a good teacher never knew machine leaening and ai could be this interesting,positive
carrie ann i want to thank you for bringing so much enthusiasm to the topic this is exciting stuff but it can be shown in a very static and boring way and you dont do that,positive
i love how the code was placed right next to the decision tree it was so simple to understand the tree and with the code right next to the branches i felt the same simplicity merge over as i looked at the code definitely a smart way to relieve the anxiety of trying to figure out a new code seeing this makes me think that if kids are exposed to math and science examples like this in programming courses or even in after school activities theyd be even more adaptable to learning how to code you guys are amazing please keep the videos coming,positive
the most fascinating part about deepminds alphazero is that it did not need humancreated training data it only needed to play itself enough times and by sheer volume become a master humans cant do that unfortunately,positive
i would really love to see a crash course series on the practical skills that scientists need ie latex soldering writing a research paper advanced lab skills etc,positive
as someone aiming to double major in entomology and computer science this video is right up my alley love the example chosen for this episode,positive
as a newcomer to machine learning this was a great overview thank you,positive
spectacularly well done video on fairly complex topics im new to machine learning in general and i want to learn more ill be watching your other videos on related topics next thank you,positive
im taking a machine learning course and this is what i needed to completely understand each method great video concise and easy to follow thanks,positive
amazing content straight to the point whilst still being detailed,positive
amazing content straight to the point whilst still being detailed,positive
i love how the explanation is made to everyone with experience or not in this issue i’m in the second group and now i have a reference to start thank you ,positive
great it gives an overview of the subject and acts as a roadmap to dive deeper into the study of ml,positive
this is awesome package your stuff into a udemy teaching course that rewards you for all this shared knowledge and wisdom about ml,positive
if machines are so good at learning maybe they can start teaching soon,positive
chillest programming channel ive ever stumbled upon good shit bro keep it up,positive
step 1 embrace mathematics step 2 master python computer science fundamentals step 3 start mathematical modelling and take up projects step 4 be patient and above all dont loose hope,positive
woah this video was epic i think the work youre doing here is really important i try to stop myself from slipping into the ol zarg langauge on the daily glad to know im not alone in our fight i think they have some sort of brain infiltration device or something,positive
im so happy i found this video and your channel this was so useful for me i thought i was the only one who felt andrew ng was speaking zarglar after the first couple of modules youve inspired me to try again with the tryget stuckresearch and repeat method thanks,positive
thank you i think my education goes well with ml or ai i got a degree in psychology neurobiology focus math and cs just started pursuing python once more to go into data science,positive
you did a great job introducing the how to learn aspect of what i think stumps a lot of intimidated curious learners basically when you explained when i saw this i didnt know what it meant so i googled it that is crazily enough a big lesson to learn just hearing that at least is encouraging me to take my first independent steps to learning this stuff so of course thanks for the video,positive
this may be the best youtube tutorial ever making the process of learning this entertaining is fantastic i had to go about it in the same way and i wish there had been a video like this years ago sending this to my son thanks,positive
i had the same exact problem when i started learning too much jargon and not enough explaining the tutorial series by a channel called giantneuralnetwork was great because he teaches you not only the theory but also how to actually code a simple neural network he does it very visually and it is very well done,positive
very insightful i learned a lot thank you,positive
now thats interesting i had been seeing devops all the time on this channel and now its time to put ml dl and ds stuffs,positive
interesting and knowledgeable presentation,positive
thanks for super simple explanation,positive
very nice overview thanks,positive
is there any toolproduct in ibm which i can use to ingest various types of data who provides me builtin machine learning algo to predicts actionable insights based on pattern without spending anything for certain time or size of data i really believe ibm is way advance in aiml than any other big players but its just how you market it,positive
i guess you cant teach selfdriving cars using rl in the real world punishing them if they collide would be a little too late so i would guess that rl is used only in lab simulations and then later in the real world these systems are only performing the task without actively using rl do i get it right,negative
nice summary,positive
it seems all the good teachers are lefthanded i hope i can be one too,positive
weldone luv awesome presentation ,positive
seriously this plugin kite is awesome and saves you a ton of time plus its free try it out,positive
thank you for the recommendations i’m really into ai programming and i want to leave my truck driver job to start as a programmer i’ve working with that about five years ago even been 36 i am definitely going for it,positive
this was awesome as someone who is still only recently introduced into the cs field and interested in perhaps dabbling in mlai this was really helpful for people like me thank you,positive
the most surprising thing for me is that i have always been interested in ai but did not know what computer science classes to take to follow this through i ended up taking a fundamentals to data science class this semsester and it taught me much of the basic ai algorithms that you mentioned i guess luck is on my side lol,positive
also it may be wise to learn matlab to a fairly advanced level before doing ml the jump from basic python to ml is quite a big one i was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it you must know how to populate matrices by row and column take the average etc a basic python course wont cover these things but matlab courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist,negative
hey tim good video one thing i would say is that i wouldnt recommend beginners to start with reinforcement learning as a matter of fact i think thats one of the more advanced applications supervised learning with neural nets or computer vision would be my suggestions before going to reinforcement,positive
you’re an amazing speaker and explain concepts very well thanks for your invaluable videos,positive
really liked the stepbystep breakdown of the process the whole video was very informative,positive
laurence thank you so much for taking the time to put out such concise intuitive walkthroughs you manage to make everything going on behind the curtain really accessible and unintimidating,positive
nice explanation i am also building a course on ml in python for a university more from an implementation perspective this surely helps,positive
i love these tutorials and videos that tensorflow puts out super informative thank you laurence what a great video you bet ill keep watching these series have a fantastic day everyone,positive
subscribed after watching this love the way you explain you explain the concept very clearly and also you add a little bit of the code which gives me a great preparation for the coding application keep up the good work lawrence,positive
hey there lawrence really good explanation thanks for putting together just wanted to ask how often these vids will come out,positive
thank you for explaining this so clearly and eloquently,positive
great explanation i loved the way you explained it im excited to see more,positive
was just waiting for this from lawrence i m learning machine learning daily and time to take this to next level thanks lawrence and google and tensor flow,positive
extremely helpful explanation thank you very much,positive
this video is soo good i watched this many times to understand what ml is i studied matlab at university this video is also good for review of ml,positive
i have launched my own start up in celebration of that we are giving away 10000 in crypto make sure to enter the metacent 10000 giveaway,positive
you should learn machine learning even if you dont intend to be a machine learning engineer ml is a tool an important one that can help make sense from data in the future knowing how to use ml as a tool will be equivalent to knowing how to use excel today it doesnt mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesnt know how to use one,positive
well as someone who likes research in ai i give major credit to software engineer the math is pretty intense to always remember so software engineers are very good at making black boxes that are reusable so i think everyone in technology is just as important,positive
i absolutely agree with you from my experience toward my research machine learning is only useful if there is data available to extract features however if you are extracting features from unknown observation then modelbased approach is very useful these days a hybrid between modelbased approach and machine learning techniques are useful,positive
great video smitha i have been working as a developer for about a year now and i just landed a job as a data scientist i’m hoping to transition into ml in a few years,positive
thank you for the honest talk the more i learn about machine learning the more i realize that what you say is true at the same time everyone is different some people will simply do anything to work in ml and thats okay,positive
i took an introductory crash course and some of the simple projects that we did were so cool that i want to learn more about ml and make more exciting projects thanks for guidance,positive
thank you for the info however i think this advice applies to just about every career especially in the fast changing world we are in even accounting has to be looked at,positive
wow massive learnings thanks i wonder if you wouldn’t mind discussing the kind of limitations a hobbyist would face what kind of projects are possible,positive
i have been studying deep learning for the last 3 weeks or so and this guy explained it like in 20 minutes i wish i had a teacher like him,positive
there should be a button of mega like for this video great explanation of an epic tool thanks a lot,positive
the best explanation of convolution in few minutes ,positive
this is an amazing smooth intro to a relatively complicated topic the qr codes are a smart move hoping to see more videos on similar topics thank you both,positive
wow ive been reading about this stuff a lot but always had difficulty wrapping my head around it i did the tensorflow demos but was unable to understand it well enough to try something on my own he explained it very clearly and cleaned up a lot of my misunderstanding thank you so much for sharing,positive
i cant even tell you how much more i enjoy using tensorflow 20 than i did using the previous versions thank you for all the great improvements a special thank you for tensorboard a very useful and fun tool,positive
laurences explanations were wonderful thorough but also simple enough that even a newbie can understand it thank you,positive
wow this was an awesome presentation ill focus on the first speaker since i was somewhat familiar with the subject i also liked the second one he explained all of the key concepts as clearly as i have seen and i have looked at a lot of videos this is a master class in how to do it i hope he presents on many more related topics definitely worth watching thank you so much,positive
amazing video theres many elements here that are explained so well looking forward to doing more stuff with tf in the future,positive
i wish i had watched this a year ago easy to understand with great details thank you sir,positive
this is the best quick explanation of machine learning i have seen to date you covered the first few weeks of the course extremely well and concisely i shared with all my friends to get them more hyped about machine learning,positive
with gradient descent we generally dont update one parameter and then another rather parameter updates are done simultaneously great video overall i like how you started with a simple model structure and skipped the derivations to keep things understandable to a broader audience,positive
hey it would be great if u could do a machine learning course for complete beginners here on youtube i really enjoyed this vedio thanks you so much for this,positive
nice video hands down your channel has delivered the most useful information to me and my future not to mention interesting videos like this one ive been doing discrete math stuff and so its refreshing to learn about more continuous and applied math concepts,positive
this is a great explanation of a very complex subject while incorporating and utilizing such a topic doesnt require an intense understanding of the process it does help to share the facts with others,positive
thank you for your video i was wondering if youve done an electrical engineering degree would you have enough of the relevant math covered to go into machine learning artificial intelligence or would you need to take some extra classes im guessing statistics would be needed but what about everything else thank you again keep up the good work,positive
i already took the coursera course but boi was this a good refresher also helps me as a cs major have a clearer idea of what math ill need to take thanks again,positive
you did a phenomenal job explaining this thanks a lot,positive
hey there happy new year speaking of the new year you might be wondering is this still valid for 2021 and the answer is yes its still valid for 2021 however you might notice a few changes to the websites mentioned throughout video some have had a design change including sites like made with ml whove recently pivoted all of the main concepts remain valid for the new year if anything changes drastically ill look to updatemake a new version of this video in the meantime happy machine learning,positive
daniel you my friend are a legend its so good to see such passion and enthusiasm for your craft and the ml community is glad to have someone like you blazing a trail so that the new members can follow,positive
presentations in the technical field such as this rarely have this much quality knowledge packed into them but its even rarer that they are this aesthetically pleasing,positive
daniel thanks for this superb video as someone just starting out on this road its very easy to get sucked into the fine details but this has given me a much better grasp of the big picture i love your philosophy of not learning for learnings sake but using this knowledge to build things that matter to people keep doing what youre doing,positive
hello daniel just wanted to say thank you for sharing your knowledge and resources i have been following you for weeks now and your channel is my favorite to learn about machine learning very inspiring and insightful thank you and keep up the good work mate cheers aymane,positive
wow thank you for the incredible amount of work you put into this project it is truly an amazing creation very useful and relative information and the interactive map is really cool stupendous,positive
now this is something else the best instructions to learning ml i have ever seen thank you daniel for the effort you put in this now i can really start to learn ml like a true legend thank you sir,positive
ive never left a comment on youtube but i feel like i must do after watching this video it is very organized and useful to understand how we approach ml and keep learning it i appreciate you made this great one,positive
this is gold thanks mate just about to begin my journey of learning data science and machine learning and this has definitely helped me to orient myself within the field all the best,positive
daniel this is an amazing video i came back to say thank you for putting extensive work to make this video the map instructions and resources are super helpful this is the best guidance i have seen so far thank you daniel,positive
first lecture in the 2019 deep learning series its humbling to have the opportunity to teach at mit and exciting to be part of the ai community thank you all for the support and great discussions over the past few years its been an amazing ride,positive
i really admire the work that lex is doing both at mit and his podcast,positive
thanks professor its noticeable that you put on the effort to put things in context very good,positive
thank you so much lex this will help us a lot this will help the students who cant afford paid online courses and none in the neighbourhood can teach,positive
this lecture is awesome and really inspiring ive been a fan now for years now lex and im really happy to see your success i just wanted to point out that i believe your analysis of one shot learning re human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base the learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling sitting up and standing up this process takes usually between 1 and 2 years this time and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible the process can be accelerated through coordinationspecific training on the part of the parents which occurs quite often errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road eg requiring knee replacement at 55 bipedalism is pretty complex and is way harder than quadrupedalism which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim,positive
a great introduction lecture full of “fruit” i learned a lot in just a hour thanks a lot for sharing,positive
this is great amazing lecture one question though about the baby walking isnt it very hard to quantify the data points synaptic firing a babies brain accesses when learning to walk if we dont fully understand the brain and neurological connection how do we quantify and compare the training data between the human brain and ai,positive
thank you so much mr lex fridman for contribution and sharing your lectures,positive
lex is a really admirable professor applying academy to solve real world problems through engineering ways kudos,positive
absolutely amazing i love how you explained this,positive
i started studying computer science 2015 i really never knew much about computer science i started in the first semester with a programming course and came across this video and i was fascinated by this now in the last semester i am writing my bachelorthesis in neural networks you were my inspiration,positive
revisiting this video today this the video that got me into ai im a deep learning engineer today thanks sethbling cheers,positive
this video was my first exposure to neural networks when i was in high school now i’m a machine learning engineer at google,positive
a year ago i used this video to explain to my class what artificial intelligence was or something like that i dont remember since i live in mexico i had to translate and explain everything thanks for the video i learned my classmates were entertained and i gave my teacher a good impression,positive
sethbling will make a sentient being using mario world code injection lol this whole stuff is super amazing love it d,positive
few year back i watched this video as a newbie student and it give me a motivation to pursue ai as my career now im writing my master thesis and will soon join a company as machine learning engineer revising this video feels so nostalgic thanks sethbling kudos d,positive
that is downright fascinating makes me wish i went into programming,positive
this is undoubtedly one of the best precise and to the point tutorial videos on any learning site ive tried many videos but this has by far taught me the most thanks so much,positive
thank you sir for providing such a comprehensive knowledge on ml algorithms i would like to share that the portion covered in this video is what is asked in most of the data analysis ml interviews this basics are the building blocks to grow upon,positive
very nice im taking a machine learning class on coursrea and after watching this i understand more of how to implement the algorithms the class actually got me confused on how to apply it to daily tasksprojects now i have some projects in mind d,positive
as always great quality lectures by simplilearn thank you,positive
hello sir thank you for this great tutorial can you send me the datasets for more practice please thank you in advance,positive
thank you so much for this wonderful online turtorial i am a beginner to ml and this tutorial are so helpful may i ask where can i get the data that has been used in this video for practice thank uuuu,positive
thank you siryour team is doing so good for the purpose of helping studentslove respect for simple learning team,positive
very well explained very good video for beginners i highly recommend thank you so much for explaining in detail the pace is absolutely perfect,positive
this is really a good video for starters in machine learning thank you for it it would be really helpful if you could share the datasets used in the examples for selfpractice i dont prefer to share my email id here in public chat please advise on alternatives to share my email id for datasets thank you,positive
started this video casually and got stuck to it for 2 hours eventually gonna finish the whole important course great information smoothly explained raghu raman,positive
this is awesome theres absolutely no way im going to watch this right now but its great to see this quantity and quality of information posted for public benefit im subscribing and sharing,positive
hi op my question is regarding the challenge of dealing with datasets in my project the feature set contains about 40 columns from merging10 csv files to train my model but the test dataset contains just 2 columns including the target column so each time i try to make classification on the target column i get a failure notice telling me that my training and test shape are not the same how can i make my model to make prediction based on the test dataset given to me or how can i adapt my test dataset to conform to the training dataset in shape in order to run my program,negative
thats a fantastic video i dont watched full but the way he taught is absolutely amazing it will very beneficial if the videos are of 1 hour length and divided in playlist so that if a person dont have enough data balance can download one chunk at a time it is very difficult to watch the video of this length at a time,positive
thank you so much for the informative lectures better than many college level courses but how can we get an access to the notebooks,positive
loved your content very much learned by practicing with automotive related data being a mechanical engineer lot of hurdles faced though but that is how you learn i say would appreciate a complete lecture of this particular session where entire ml is taught checked your playlist of ml are those continuation of these classes would appreciate your quick response how can i utilize ml in manufacturing auto sector in india since want to be in core also work on technological advancement using software since i like both the streams lot of questions though would like to get response,positive
thanks mr raghuraman you really covered the basics as they should be this is the way to cover the pg course on python thanks a lot,positive
im amazed by seeing your understanding with every algorithm one day ill also be able to do the same,positive
thank you for this wonderful session can we have slides of this session,positive
sir i just want to say thank you to help us gain this knowledge and encourage us to start our data science journey,positive
clear information clarify every important point cover all topics thanks krish i participated you live session also ,positive
excellent sessioneverything about ml is summarised in a single video which provides the complete picture of the elephant,positive
your explanation is really good and content wise excellent sir thanks for sharing your videos and roadmaps and end2end explanation interview point of view,positive
perfect binge watch for interview preparation thanks for uploading this krish,positive
thank you for putting everything together ,positive
i am 41 i wish i had had the education those kids were getting the string activity was awesome to understand how connected we are,positive
insightful film also loved how all the characters were brought together at the end,positive
if you really dig in deeper to find ais and machine learning reaching capabilities then theyre really greater than us but always in specific sense they doesnt posses capability to be more general like human but they outperform humans by incredible power in given specific tasks,positive
it is not a question if ai is good or bad it is a question of using it in a good or bad way another thing is many people resist change of any type resisting change means that those people will be totally unable to cope when the change becomes everywhere,negative
if the old guy is my grandfather i think we would be talking about technologies all day long nice video,positive
love it thats why i teach kids between 9 and 12 how to code educating the next generation,positive
technology looks beautiful in a documentary when you try to learn its a job,positive
with great power comes great responsibility great documentary but im afraid this superpowerful technology will be used for evil purposes as well as always in human history,negative
im just getting started with machine learning and this is a very helpful and motivating video thanks xx,positive
hey smitha thanks a lot for this great piece of advicei am currently an data analytics intern at ey i hope you make more videos on this and other useful resources,positive
thank you smitha i have been pondering over ml not knowing from where to start you have provided a good starting point i really appreciate it,positive
this is a great video something i enjoyed was the background not too much to get distracted by and you had a good presentation,positive
hello i am not yet an ml enthusiast but clicked on the video because of the slight curiosity i have about it but the nozero days mention makes sense is a good reminder that such consistency is important for achieving ones goals,positive
thankyou for this video this is really so amazing i just didnt even think that way to look at what companies want from us but either way i am going to learn it for just fun but maybe later on i would like to switch my carrier in it thankyou ,positive
i have just started to look into ml and learn more about it and this video is an absolute motivator thanks subscribed,positive
i think math is important because if you are trying to solve a problem with ml you need to at least or have an idea of what each mathematical conceptformula are going to solve and perfect for your problem,positive
hi all thanks for watching hope this course has given you a solid foundation in the world of computer vision be sure to check out my channel and connect with me on social media jasmcaus for more great content twitter youtube,positive
i watched a lots of deep learning tuturials before this some of them were even twice as long as this and yet this explained the best and the most thank you for the awesome tutorial without ads for free you are a hero,positive
this was such a great refresher course everything i needed to recollect and on point great job and thank you,positive
this is honest to god a great lecture and perfect for introducing deep learning i hope there’s another video in the future that shows some light programming,positive
it was a good introductory course although theres lack of examples in the explanation of neural network part but overall you can get the idea of how deep learning works,positive
this was such a great refresher course everything i needed to recollect and on point great job and thank you 5,positive
excellent introduction to the topic great slides great explanation right pace really good,positive
awesome video jason youve helped make this information accessible to thousands of new people,positive
short and crisp overview of deep learning with cool intuitions this is the only video that i will recommend to anyone who wants to start with deep learning and even machine learning in general,positive
great video i like the structure and the depth of knowledge shown in it,positive
this would be substantially more terrifying if the bots werent drawn to be so cute,negative
the true existential crisis comes when you realise he just described evolution in general we can recreate it we benefit from it yet we have no clue why or how its actually working beyond luck,negative
when grey was talking about the warehouses and slaughterhouses all i could do was think of star wars the bots are basically equivalent to clones on kamino i would say the bots are less sentient but the way grey has depicted them makes that less certain and the comparison all the stronger,negative
the topology of the learning network is based on that of the perceptron built in the 50s with relays in the end the network conduct a converging weighting of probabilities to identify the correct event yes even a picture is considered an event a static one though a dinamic event is defined by using vector spaces thank you for the nice video,positive
this is absolutely insane i love this video and the way it explains everything though i guess that isnt specific to this video,positive
teacher bot cant teach but it can test did you just explain the entire american school system,negative
checking in again after a google engineer claimed their lamda ai was sentient this isnt the type of machine learning that ai uses but still fascinating,positive
this was so helpful im currently trying to teach my pit amiibo how to fight properly and this is going to help me big time in training it,positive
you’re such a great teacher all the bots look sooo cute as well and comprehensible graphics like always d,positive
at times i feel so lucky being born in this age of internet otherwise it was no way possible for me to learn from this legend of machine learning for free looking at this career across academia and industry he is a pioneer it like learning integral calculus from newton himself,positive
i just love how humble and friendly this prof is big fan,positive
i am a 12thgrade student and really interested in machine learning i did some basic math which is required in machine learning and am starting with this course today i really liked the fact that the language which is used in this course is python so excited to learn about this new branch will try my best to complete it thank you stanford for uploading these lectures,positive
andrew ng is a legend i took his course on coursera and i wish the course never ended i have taking a lot of machine learning courses but none of them compare to andrews he made complex concepts look trivial and established a theoretical background intuition as he would say,positive
the way this man teaches is something which doesnt get you tired you will watch him teach with a beaming smile on your face thanks for this great class,positive
thank you for the course its very helpful for me ,positive
in todays time andrew ng is legend by his ml knowledge ,positive
very nice lecture,positive
this is so great for making these valuable ressources completely free to us would you consider uploading courses for civil engineering department thank you ,positive
so nice lectures and professors wish to attend a real lecture at mit,positive
excellent for a newbie thanks for the great effort to cover all the basis in simple but still reasonably indepth way,positive
this is a great video for overview of ai and ml will stay tuned for upcoming videos in this course thanks mit ocw,positive
wow so glad yall posted this exactly the field im trying to learn,positive
thanks a lot for describing such a big comprehensive ai information in such a way that i can easily see and understand the forest of ai especially machine learning,positive
this is so exceptional and simplified am so grateful for this,positive
its not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning sometimes you want to limit your dataset for example if youre trying to figure out if youre in a stock market recession or expansion you dont want to go over 2 years months of data because youll end up in another cycle symmetry and domain limits are important in machine learning my point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,negative
thanks a lot mit if it is possiblecould you make the videos of 1804 complex variable with applicationsi really want to watch that coursethank you very much,positive
lol what a way to present dry material with a dry approach yet making it interesting and easy to follow great job,positive
better than lots of courses on udemy i really like your humor,positive
wow this was so straight to the point with great visuals that i managed to figure out all in one go great stuff,positive
you just did it in a perfect way ive read blogs best ml books and other resources but you just nailed this thank you,positive
i wish professors taught like this such clarity i am so thankful to you,positive
this guy has united his two passions—machine learning and guitar,positive
so much of quality content on machine learning i wish i knew about this channel a bit before a must follow channel for ml ds enthusiasts great job josh please continue the good work and serve the humanity,positive
smitha i loved the layout of the video and appreciate the emphasis on book learning i am switching careers and want to emphasize ml and will follow the roadmap and let you know my thoughts much respect,positive
hey smitha thank you for the road map humbly appreciate the time you put in making these videos for us all if i may ask there is another book that i have heard is great regarding machine learning titled handson machine learning with scikitlearn keras and tensorflow by oreilly please do advise on what you think about this one,positive
just loved your content love the effort you put in every single video like its just wow keep creating the good content love,positive
thank you for an insightful video  i am currently leading a team of data analysts and planning to get started on some ml projects in the team do you have any input on how a team manager can prepare to lead a team of ml engineers any pointers will be great thank you,positive
wow congratulations for starting such an amazing project ,positive
wow smitha you did amazing job feel proud of you,positive
i am just getting started on machine learning and this roadmap is a muchneeded one thanks for creating this much appreciated,positive
loved your recommendations i didn’t knew the deep dive book looks amazing thanks,positive
i love this content and vibe of the channel thank you 3,positive
part 3 will be on backpropagation i had originally planned to include it here but the more i wanted to dig into a proper walkthrough for what its really doing the more deserving it became of its own video stay tuned,positive
im only 12 minutes into this video right now but i just wanted to say how much i appreciate the time and spacing you give to explaining a concept you add pauses you repeat things with slightly different wording and you give examples and zoom in and out linking to relevant thought processes that might help trigger an aha moment in the viewer many of these hooks actually make me understand concepts ive had trouble grasping in maths all because of your videos and the way you choose to explain things so thanks youre helping me a lot to become a smarter person,positive
dissapointed you did not animate a 13000dimensional graph would make things easier,negative
im an it student and we have an assignment on exactly this topic we even have to use the mnist data set i have to say this is absolutely lifesaving and i can not thank you enough grant what you do here is something that only a handful of people on this planet can do explain and visualize rather complicated topics beautifully and simple so from me and a lot of students all around the globe thank you so so much 3,positive
unlike most teachers of subjects like this this gentleman seems to be genuinely concerned that his audience understands him and he makes a concerted and highly successful effort to convey the ideas in a cogent digestible and stimulating form,positive
you sir deserve a noble or an oscarwhat an incredibly effective method of teaching thank you so very much no bad computer made me crack up lol,positive
one of youtubes highest quality content channels chapeau,positive
i just sat through a 3 day ml accelerator class and you series did a far better job at explaining them with 4 twenty minute videos well done mate really appreciate it thank you,positive
hands down i have never seen anyone explain mathematics so beautifully the way he does kudos,positive
thank you 3blue1brown for these videos theyre extremely instructive however theres one point that i didnt understand why does the gradient descent algorithm struggle to find local minimas with swapped labels if anyone could answer my question id be very grateful thank you,positive
i feel this is one of the best courses ive ever seen on machine learning i was looking for something like this for months now to my surprise this course just released conveniently just before my spring break 3 thank you guys,positive
thanks for your knowledge sharing sir required reinforcement learning i hv subscribed just now,positive
thank you very much for the great effort i want a video about a project ml complete to understand how it works in real life,positive
thank you for putting out this course,positive
this is great please make advance course of ml and make some good projects like spam etc,positive
thanks for doing this,positive
best channel i have ever seen,positive
thank you instructor for this awesome video you explained very thing in quite simple and easily understandable manner,positive

thanks for this video very neatly calmly explained the major ml terms,positive
much gratitude for this informative lecture,positive
but this series is great you can repost it in the next time if possible please add subtitles to the video,positive
steve is a phenomenal lecturer isnt he,positive
just wanted to comment about how much i love these videos last year while applying for phds i was searching for passions in a discussion with my friend a computer scientist i accidentally outlined genetic programming without knowing it my friend told me so and i went researching found these videos and became enthralled now i have a phd studentship in soft robotics and plan to use sindy to help with modelling and control and honestly think that giving machines brains may be my future work too thanks brunton my passion was helped by your own,positive
would love for a full series on how can we use rl to control real world dynamical systems,positive
viewing reinforcement learning as time delayed supervised learning is a really good way of looking at it,positive
i just cannot express how grateful i am to prof steve brunton for posting these videos waking up at 6am to watch him explain is the most satisfying thing ever thank you we all are grateful,positive
great channel please record more videos on the edge of reinforcement learning and control theory congrats on your work,positive
this sweet spot between control theory and machine learning definitely interests me especially applied to astrodynamical systems please continue making these videos professor brunton,positive
i’ve been following your content for a at least 4 years now it’s the reason i am a robotics control engineer now you pulled me through 4th year control systems with your convenientlytimed boot camp please keep up the great content ps are you accepting phd students,positive
great video if everyone was as great on youtube as your delivery we would have a lot more passion in the area keep up the good work train on,positive
thank you so much for this lecture i really enjoy your videos this is helpful as a phd student i also bought your book datadriven science and engineering which have nice explanations for the tools i use keep on this awesome work greetings from france,positive
order badc working of a neural network the weighted sum of the input is calculated the bias is added the result is fet to an activation function specific neuron is activated nice video it helped me to learn deep learning in 5 minutes,positive
thank you so much for your presentation i have learned a lot exercise test size02 c1 kernelpoly accuracy 9917,positive
hello great videos loved this series can you please do a video on imbalanced data sets in classifications problems maybe just add onto a previous example you have but with a case where there are very few 1 or true values compared to 0 or false thanks for you consideration,positive
got 10 score when c4 for iris data set thank you sir your machine learning playlist is a boon for beginners like me,positive
hello sir thank you for your videos it really helps from the beginner of the video which you have listed in data science playlist  the model in default method is 9965 in train and 994 in test whereas gamma method will lower down the accuracy of the model from 994 to 75 therefore it has explicit shows the gamma method is unsuitable for the scenario however the regularisation has improve the train set to 1 and testing set is retained the best accuracy of model yet kernel parameter as linear has also provided a good accuracy of model thank you for your guidance,positive
thank you very much for these videos they are really helpful i did the exercise and got 99 when c4 any increase in c did not affect the accuracy also any alteration made to gamma and kernel dropped the accuracy drastically thank you once again,positive
great sir can you elaborate something about plotting the hyperplane the decision function in matplotlib i want to see the best line which classifies the data,positive
codebasics sir could you please make a video with regression models like knn regression or random forest with traintestvalidation set thank you for your amazing videosi started my machine learning implementation journey with your tutorials,positive
what a wonderfull tutorial well done and well explained thanks a lot dude for the sharing of this expensive knowledge,positive
hope you all enjoy this video go subscribe to ryans channel for more machinelearning content,positive
just about to finish my first year studying statistics a short course was about machine learning so i have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video we got to use and tweak different types of predictor models we split the available data into training and test data and then used the training data which included the outcome variable to build the models and the test data which didnt include the outcome variable to test the models and later compare their results to the true outcome variable,positive
good interview but as someone who has already know the concept of data science and machine learning im actually interested to know what are the differences between a data scientist and a ml engineer hope this question will be answered in a future video,positive
thank you clement we need more interviews with ml engineers in your channel,positive
i really hope ryan starts a machine learning podcast or something its something i can pay for,positive
great interviewlearnt lot of thingsi have a questionis dsa so important to become a data scientist,positive
thank you simplylearn for explaining machine learning in the most precise and ambient manner i have been wanting to learn machine learning since a long back and today i scouted for your video this seriously helped me learn the basics of machine learning once again thank you so much,positive
i must thank sl team for the video absolute helpful for a layaman to understand i have queries regarding the course let me know how shall i contact,positive
thank you so much this was very informative and very well explained,positive
thanks one more time for the richful tutorial and the explanations provided i did the exercise consisting to predict the prices of the house from th boston housing dataset it works as explained in the video i just have few questions concerning the training test and prediction indeed what guide the right choice of the traintestsize and randomstate values in my code i changed the testsize value to 05 and the randomstate to 7 i got a nice prediction for arrays 3 5 but not for array9 for example and when i compute the mean squared value i get 3336 can such a value be acceptable thank you again for all,positive
absolutely awesome thanks for the video would be great to see next implementation of any ml algorithm,positive
wow i was wanting this type of video only in which i could revise all the basics of machine learning thank you so much for uploading this,positive
nice tutorial kindly upload more related to implementation demo of supervised and unsupervised learning,positive
hey this video really made me catch my understanding of what is machine learning is i referred to tons of different videos i am able to understand kind of but not meaningfully but this video gave me the complete meaning of machine learning to understand deep practically,positive
great video thank you one question in the mail filtering first example of the naive bayes theorem what event does a refers to thanks,positive
hello how are you from my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic however if you want to reach an even wider audience considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak english i suggest 1 to associate the subtitles even if in english as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery 2 that the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language thanks for the attention thanks for the video and i wish all success to the simplilearn team,positive
lot of respect sir cant thank you enough for these live sessions,positive
sir a lot of respect to you excellent session,positive
superb sir i thoroughly enjoyed of learning machine learning your energy and practical way of teaching makes more eagerness towards learning data science,positive
sir thank you for this great job please sir i have a question are we to always assume theta one while finding the gradient descent curve thank you so much i love the way you split everything for us you are so much,positive
amazing explanation i loved the way you taught ,positive
thank you sir for such amazing community classes,positive
excellent 1st session excited to do the 2nd part tomorrow i am trying to revise my ml knowledge to get back to competing in kaggle,positive
idk if you realise the intensity of positive impact you are making in many peoples life thank you so much sir for what youre doing ,positive
excellent resource sir can you please explain all the sub fields in ai ml dl like nlp computer vision etc any other major part that i dont know even in software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers like for web development frontend technologies are same html css js for backend one may choose a programming language php node js aspnet and a database again for mobile developers they may choose android ios or cross platform react native flutter with database knowledge apis basic knowledge on how web works my question is in software engineering one may become a very good software engineer even he only concentrates on web or mobile dev can an ai ml engineer pick his career in his filed of specialization like only nlp engineer knows very less about computer vision or computer vision engineer knows very less about nlp,positive
all i want to say that you are a blessing and i commend your dedication and effort even coming from a phd in computer engineering your materials have helped me a lot i wish you the best in all your endeavors,positive
hey there firstly i cant thank you enough for starting this channel  im here after i saw your video about how to pick up the basic skills to become a data analyst in 3 months video and want to let you know that i had started the google data analytics course on coursera about 45 days ago and have finished 2 courses in the certificate series do you think it is possible for me to pick up the same skills you mentioned in your video through this course do you think the google badge on the certificate might give it an edge i honestly feel the pathway you described in your video takes a more in depth approach which might be beneficial would really really love to hear your thoughts on this it would really mean a lot if you replied thank you,positive
thank you so much for all that you do sir they are extremely helpful,positive
thanks for your time and effort the way you have designed and presented is awesome you made many peoples life easier thanks again,positive
this channel is such a blessing and a goldmine of quality content also loved the soothing background music,positive
in my eyes the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml in many cases i would eagerly wait for about 56 hours for the model to train to see it not work at all in the way i intended id keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the code to see its performance not getting better at all,negative
tim always posts videos on topics that i am currently practicinghave in mind these coincidences happens so much its scary lol love your vids ,positive
im a data scientist and 95 of my job is data collection and preparation its still a cool job but its not all model development,positive
the only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop it was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases it might go on for even a week with gpus it pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company this video didnt give any valuable inputs to make a decision,negative
tim you should post more about machine learning also please try to make a video on how to use the model for production it will be really helpful,positive
me resultó tan inspirador conocerte haydé me estoy amigando con las matemáticas para poder profundizar más en estos temas,positive
excelente explicación haydé conceptualmente logré relacionar el machine learning con mi carrera gracias a ti a tu mamá y a tu tía no entiendes realmente algo a menos que seas capaz de explicárselo a tu abuela a einstein,positive
esta chica es estupenda mis elogios para ella sin duda alguna necesitamos mas personas así en latinoamerica,positive
qué charla tan genial e inspiradora yo también soy desarrolladora y estoy empezando en este área para mi tesis y me ha motivado un montón ver a alguien que ya está en el tema y que le augura un futuro tan prometedor además estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo el esfuerzo nunca traiciona y estudiar es el catalizador más eficiente para lograr el éxito gracias por haber subido el vídeo,positive
muchas gracias haydé por tu plática me inspiró muchísimo actualmente trabajo en usa como arquitecto de sistemas y le he puesto muchas pausas el empezar a aprender algo de machine learning me genera inseguridad el hecho de que en la escuela no me fue muy bien en las matemáticas sin embargo como tú dices es solo cuestión de entrenarse y entrenarse muchas gracias,positive
uuyyyy gracias por compartir tu experiencia que va a ser de inspiración para mi vida soy estudiante de ingeniería electrónica de quinto semestre y con estas historias mi motivación crece para ser ingeniero que haga cosas grandiosas y no ser del montón gracias gracias gracias,positive
i really enjoyed this conversation with andrew heres the outline 000 introduction 223 first few steps in ai 505 early days of online education 1607 teaching on a whiteboard 1746 pieter abbeel and early research at stanford 2317 early days of deep learning 3255 quick preview deeplearningai landingai and ai fund 3323 deeplearningai how to get started in deep learning 4555 unsupervised learning 4940 deeplearningai continued 5612 career in deep learning 5856 should you get a phd 10328 ai fund building startups 11114 landingai growing ai efforts in established companies 12044 artificial general intelligence,positive
i have a phd in ai and i can say that andrew is the best machine learningai educator i have ever seen on the field the deeplearning specialization is just invaluable for any interested learner in dl,positive
one of the people that inspired me to do artificial intelligence in areas that matter without coursera i would have not gotten where i am today thank you for this conversation lex,positive
whenever someone uses the word it turns out i remember andrew ng i love andrew ng,positive
“when someone else allowed me the good fortune of helping them a little bit”its a great time to be alive when people like you lex and andrew share your knowledge with the world simply to help them a little bit i believe the little bits will make the world a better place,positive
as a genxer i enjoyed this interview so much it made me actually feel like i was experiencing the internet we were promised decades ago a well thought out and intelligent conversation that in the end leaves the viewer in a state better than when they first pressed the play button well done,positive
i took ngs class on coursera years ago it switched my career trajectory from academic to industry and spurred my interest in making things awesome to see this interview,positive
this man got a great voiceover career available at anytime,positive
this week has been awesome first scott aaronson and now andrew ng lex itd be really cool if you could get someone working on the theoretical aspects of machine learning like sanjeev arora ankur moitra or costis daskalakis itd be super interesting to see the conversation between experts on two different sides of the same coin applied and theoretical,positive
im a physician from brazil learning ai and this fine man helped me a lot thank you sir i salute you,positive
machine learning is an incredibly powerful numerical tool man i love how far weve come technologically,positive
you have the best way to describe what machine learning is i was wondering what its real meaning and i then found your answer in video i recommend all who dont know the meaning to see this video thanks oxford,positive
great introduction question is it always the case that humans need to input the potential features that are used for classification for instance the ml algorithm uses the animals height length and face size as features for classification with computer vision being used to map images to these features do some ml algorithms create these features and features maps automatically or are these always created outside of the algorithm ps what did you use to create this video it looks great,positive
i love the way you explained plus the diversity,positive
ai is already here and that is not such a bad thing can computers become self aware yes i think so in the not too distant future,positive
best explanation of machine learning,positive
awesome succinct very effective for a newbie to understand the concept,positive
well explanation love it,positive
great animationkeep it up,positive
thanks for sharing what is machine learning using such good animation,positive
i am currently enrolled in a msc machine learning masters here in the uk and we are learning both the theory and putting it into practice using the assignments there really isnt a problem of doing it both stop telling yourself you cant if you put in the time and effort with the right learning mindset and method you can learn to eat and drink at the same time just need to be smart about it stop putting these limiting thoughts on yourself it really isnt that hard,positive
i came for a machine learning related talk but i got a life lesson thanks daniel nice content ps i was thinking about going into ml field but i now realized its due to engineer disease im sticking with web apps at least for some time until i can decide what i love and what i dont,positive
ive worked for about 2 years with mlcomputer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated when i started out i was frustrated that i couldnt dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but i realized there are a lot of boring things that need to be in place before thats even relevant data curation annotation testing frameworks etc just to name a few there are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that i probably wouldnt even realize existed if i stayed in academia for a phd i think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning tools for the sake of tools and solving problems though as long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh,positive
i come from a physics background and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can a lot of colleagues in my department dont understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop during my masters i realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects now that im finishing my masters and starting to get into ml engineering i see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want amazing content you put there mate thanks from brazil,positive
i really like the point about engineering toolboxes i think that’s where a lot of the burnout comes from i work in devops and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap learning how to build better ml pipelines are much more worth my time,positive
i’ve just started exploring this field and this was a really good reminder to get so early on the journey thanks a lot,positive
hey daniel just discovered your channel a couple days ago and im learning lots thank you,positive
this is great focus is key a playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience for those interested in r and python the latest r studio ide is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate it can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in r and statistics you can run ml scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ,positive
